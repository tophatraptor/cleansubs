-Nothing.

Nothing! Oh, uh, one
of the lunch ladies died.

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,774
They found her in the gym with,
like, two holes in her neck

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,843
and all the blood drained
out of her.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,678
Good lord! Who does
something like that?

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,280
Obviously a vampire.
W-w-where's the pepper?

the vampire down?

it was about vampires,
