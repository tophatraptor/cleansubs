STEVE,
I JUST GOT A WEIRD E-MAIL.

DID YOU BUY US
AIRLINE TICKETS?

AW, SHOOT.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE.

I WANTED
TO THANK YOU

FOR LETTING ME LIVE HERE
ALL THIS TIME,

SO I'M TREATING THE FAMILY
TO A VACATION!

STEVE,
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

THANKS, UNCLE STEVE!
BEST UNCLE EVER.

LOOK OUT,
WORLD.

THE SMITH FAMILY
IS GOING TO PARIS!

SUMMER:
YEAH! AWESOME!

RICK, I DON'T LIKE GLOWING ROCKS
IN THE KITCHEN TRASH!

WELL,
I DON'T LIKE

YOUR UNEMPLOYED GENES
IN MY GRANDCHILDREN, JERRY,

BUT LIFE IS MADE
OF LITTLE CONCESSIONS.

I --
YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU'RE GONNA LAND
ON YOUR FEET, JER.

SOME COMPANY OUT THERE'S
GONNA THANK THEIR LUCKY STARS

THEY HIRED
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

WHO THE [BLEEP]
ARE YOU?
MY GOOFY BROTHER,
STEVE.

[ CHUCKLES ] HE'S BEEN
LIVING HERE ALMOST A YEAR NOW.

ARE YOU
LOSING YOUR MIND?

HEY,
SOMEONE'S BEEN SPENDING

TOO MUCH TIME
AROUND GLOWING ROCKS.

AM I RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]

[ SCREAMING ]

OH, MY GOD!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

JERRY: OH, GOD! STEVE!
WHAT THE HELL, RICK?!
WHAT THE HELL?!

WILL EVERYBODY JUST RELAX
FOR A SECOND?

THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN "UNCLE STEVE."

THAT IS
AN ALIEN PARASITE.
[ SCREECHES ]

[ BOTH GASP ]

BUT I'VE KNOWN HIM
MY WHOLE LIFE.

NO, YOU HAVEN'T,
JERRY.

THESE TELEPATHIC
LITTLE BASTARDS,

THEY EMBED THEMSELVES
IN MEMORIES,

AND TH-THEN THEY USE THOSE
TO MULTIPLY

AND SPREAD OUT,
TAKE OVER PLANETS.

IT'S --
IT'S DISGUSTING.

STEVE WASN'T REAL?

HE'S A REAL
PIECE OF [BLEEP]

THIS IS A BIG ONE.
SOMEBODY PROBABLY

TRACKED IT IN LAST WEEK
ON THE BOTTOM OF THEIR SHOE

ON A PIECE OF ALIEN FRUIT.

SOMEONE?
GET OFF THE HIGH ROAD,
SUMMER.

WE ALL
GOT PINK EYE

BECAUSE YOU WON'T STOP TEXTING
ON THE TOILET.

BUT UNCLE STEVE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE!

NO, "STEVE" PUT THAT MEMORY
IN YOUR BRAIN

SO HE COULD LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE,
EAT YOUR FOOD, AND MULTIPLY.

WE COULD BE INFESTED
WITH THESE THINGS.

[ BELCHES ]
SO WE GOT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT

FOR ANY ZANY, WACKY CHARACTERS
THAT POP UP.

OOH, WHEE!

WHATEVER YOU WANT, RICK!
WE'RE HERE TO HELP!

I ALWAYS COULD
COUNT ON YOU.

HAVE BLAST SHIELDS?

TRUST ME, BETH,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

HOW MANY ANSWERS
THAT QUESTION HAS.

OOH, GOSH,
IT FEELS CLAUSTROPHOBIC!

REMINDS ME
OF THAT TIME

WE ALL GOT STUCK
IN THE ELEVATOR TOGETHER.

Y-- REMEMBER THAT?
AFTER "THE HULK" MUSICAL?

[ GRUNTING ]
[  MUZAK PLAYING]

JERRY, BUTTONS DON'T WORK BETTER

AND FOAM FISTS
DON'T MAKE YOU STRONG.

WHY COULDN'T I BRING
MY PORTAL GUN?

[ WINCES ]

WHY DID ALL THE DRINKS
HAVE TO BE EXTRA LARGE?

OH, THE HULK.
I JUST GOT THAT.

JUST PEE YOUR PANTS. I DID IT
THE MINUTE WE GOT STUCK.

OH, OH, YEAH, YEAH,
SHAME ME.

AT LEAST WHEN I'M DISGUSTING,
IT'S ON PURPOSE.

OH, Y'ALL,
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE FOR
YOU GUYS, AND I ALWAYS WILL BE.

[ CHUCKLES ]
SOMEBODY CALL FOR REPAIRS?

ALL:
YAY! COUSIN NICKY!

IT'S ME,
COUSIN NICKY.

I'M WALKIN' HERE!
I MEAN, I'M NOT.

I'M CROUCHED
IN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT,

BUT HEY,
I'M WALKIN' HERE!

[ LAUGHTER ]

IT'S TRUE.

WE REALLY DO GET INTO SOME
CRAZY SITUATIONS AS A FAMILY,

MOSTLY WHEN
WE'RE COOPED UP LIKE THIS.

HEY, MAYBE MR. POOPYPANTS
IS RIGHT.

L-LET'S GET
SOME FRESH AIR.

COME ON, COUSIN NICKY.
YOU HEARD RICK.

WE HAVE TO
STAY QUARANTINED

UNTIL WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
NO MORE OF THESE THINGS.

I HEAR YOU,

WE GOT A SAYIN' --

"WE'RE WALKIN' HERE!"

NICKY, GET --

OH!
[ GASPS ]

[ GROANING ]
WHAT THE...?

COUSIN NICKY
WAS A PARASITE?!

SIX, MORTY! THERE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE SIX OF US!

IF THERE'S SEVEN, THEN
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY'S NOT REAL.

BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS NICKY?

I GUESSED. THAT'S WHY I AIMED
FOR HIS SHOULDER.

SO WE CAN'T TRUST
ANY OF OUR MEMORIES NOW?

NICKY WAS THE REASON WE FOUND
THAT OLD NAZI SUBMARINE.

DID THAT
NOT EVEN HAPPEN?

WELL,
OF COURSE IT HAPPENED.

NOW THAT I POSSESS
THE MIGHTY STAFF OF RAH-GUBABA,

THE WORLD WILL TREMBLE
BEFORE THE FOURTH REICH!

THIS IS
THE LAST TIME

I ASK YOU FOR HELP
ON MY HISTORY FINAL, RICK.

HEY, WE GOT A WORD FOR NAZIS
BACK IN BROOKLYN, PAL.

I'M COMFORTABLE BEING CALLED
A NAZI.

YOU THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER
WORD THAT WILL HURT MY FEELINGS?

YEAH. THINK BEFORE
YOU TALK [BLEEP]

MR. BEAUREGARD!

AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION,
I HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RETIRE.

ALL: YEAH!
OH, THANK GOD!

NOW, I BELIEVE SOMEONE
HAS A FINAL EXAM TO ATTEND.

SET A COURSE
FOR MORTY'S HIGH SCHOOL.

PERHAPS I'M BIASED, BUT IF
THAT STORY NEVER HAPPENED,

THEN I WOULDN'T STILL BE
THE FAMILY BUTLER.

[ CHUCKLES ]
DARE TO DREAM.

WAIT.

AND IF MR. BEAUREGARD
WASN'T OUR BUTLER,

IT'S SAFE TO SAY THE FAMILY'D BE
IN A HELL OF A LOT OF TROUBLE.

[ LAUGHTER ]
NO!
DON'T FLASHBACK!

YOU'RE JUST GONNA MAKE

DON'T WORRY, JERRY.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHORT GAME?

>> OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!

[ CRYING ] WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHORT

GAME?!

[ PLINK ]

>> OOH, NICE!

[ BOTH MOAN ]

>> JERRY: I THINK WE'LL TAKE OUR

FOOD TO GO.

>> NO, YOU WON'T.

THE POLICE ARE COMING.

YOU HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO

ANSWER.

>> JERRY: FAIR ENOUGH.

[ VILLAGERS CHEER ]

[ CHICKEN SQUAWKS ]

>> THANK YOU, KIND SIR.

OUR VILLAGE IS SAVED!

YOU ARE BOTH TRUE HEROES!

>> MORTY: OH! [ LAUGHS ]

>> RICK: GOOD JOB, MORTY.

LOOKS LIKE YOU WON THE BET.

>> MORTY: THANKS, RICK, BUT I

DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.

YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT

THE UNIVERSE.

IT'S A CRAZY AND CHAOTIC PLACE.

>> RICK: WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE

THAT'S WHY IT COULD USE A LITTLE

CLEANING UP [BURPS] EVERY NOW

AND THEN, YOU KNOW.

THIS ONE'S WRAPPED UP NEAT AND

CLEAN BECAUSE WE DID IT MORTY

STYLE.

>> OH! HEROES, WE WOULD LIKE TO

INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR BELOVED

KING SO THAT HE MAY THANK YOU

PERSONALLY.

>> MORTY: UH, NO, I-IT'S COOL.

RICK. PORTAL. HURRY.

>> AAH!

[ VILLAGERS SCREAM ]

>> JERRY: SO...

YOU STILL THINKING ABOUT TAKING

THAT TRIP?

>> BETH: [ SIGHS ] JERRY, LOOK.

WE DON'T HAVE A PERFECT

MARRIAGE, BUT I'M NOT GOING

ANYWHERE.

WHEN WE WERE IN THAT FREEZER, I

REALIZED THE MEESEEKS ARE LIKE

THE GUYS I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

WITH  WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING

TO "COMPLETE THEIR TASK."

>> JERRY: WAS I ONE OF THOSE

GUYS?

>> BETH: THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU

DIDN'T DISAPPEAR AFTERWARDS.

>> JERRY: WELL...

I GOT YOU PREGNANT.

>> BETH: YEAH...

>> RICK: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

TO THIS PLACE?

>> BETH: UH, YOUR MEESEEKS BOX

HAPPENED.

THEY WENT CRAZY WHEN THEY

COULDN'T TAKE TWO STROKES OFF

JERRY'S GOLF GAME.

HE FELT TERRIBLE.

>> RICK: HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT

THAT JERRY'S AN IDIOT.

>> BETH: DAD!

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO

CLEAN THIS PLACE UP?

>> RICK: WELL, YOU KNOW, I DO

HAVE A FLEESEEKS BOX.

>> JERRY: NO. NO MORE BOXES.

>> RICK: WHAT?

IT JUST HAS A MOP AND SOME FLOOR

WAX IN IT.

WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUBS!

[ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH! THAT'S MY NEW THING!

I'M KIND OF LIKE WHAT'S HIS

NAME  AR-ARSENIO.

ISN'T THAT  IT'S WHAT ARSENIO

USED TO SAY ON HIS SHOW.

WOBBLE GOBBA LOP BOPS!

RIGHT?

SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, EVERYBODY.

>> BETH: I DON'T GET IT.

[ RAPID FOOTSTEPS ]

>> [ PANTING ]

SIR, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

WANT TO SEE THIS.

WE FOUND IT INSIDE A LOCKBOX

INSIDE KING JELLY BEAN'S CLOSET.

>> [ RETCHES ]

>> WE HAVE TO TELL THE PEOPLE.

>> WAIT.

DESTROY IT.

OUR PEOPLE WILL GET MORE FROM

THE IDEA HE REPRESENTED THAN

FROM THE JELLY BEAN HE ACTUALLY

WAS.

 WILL YOU PLEASE... </ I>

 NOT MARRY ME?
I CHOOSE VERONICA. </ I>

- WHAT?
- YES!

- CALLED IT. - WHY WOULD HE CHOOSE VERONICA?
- BECAUSE HE LOVES HER.

WELL--IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, SUMMER,

NONE OF IT MATTERED, AND
THE ENTIRE SHOW IS STUPID.

OKAY, I'VE GOT
AN IDEA, RICK.

YOU SHOW US YOUR CONCEPT OF "GOOD
TV," AND WE'LL CRAP ALL OVER THAT.

I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

HEY!

OH, COOL! IS THAT CRYSTALLIZED ZANTHONITE?
IT CONDUCTS ELECTRONS ACROSS DIMENSIONS.

TWENTY PERCENT ACCURATE, AS USUAL, MORTY.
THE IMPORTANT THING BEING I JUST UPGRADED

OUR CABLE PACKAGE WITH PROGRAMMING
FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE REALITY.

WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN WE GET
SHOWTIME EXTREME?

HOW ABOUT SHOWTIME EXTREME IN A
WORLD WHERE MAN EVOLVED FROM CORN.

 WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT.
WE'RE BOTH CORN OF ACTION. </ I>

 YEAH. BUT ONE OF
US IS...DEAD CORN! </ I>

- BORING.
- SUMMER,

YOU JUST SPENT THREE MONTHS,
WATCHING A MAN CHOOSE A FAKE WIFE.

SO WHAT? IT'D BE BETTER IF
THE PEOPLE WERE CORN?

JERRY, YOU DON'T GET IT.
THIS IS INFINITE TV...

FROM INFINITE
UNIVERSES. LOOK.

 THIS SHIT IS DELICIOUS. </ I>

A MOVIE ABOUT A
GUY EATING SHIT.

A VIOLENT
ANTIQUES SHOW...

- IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU.
- THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

LETTERMAN FROM A
TIME LINE WHERE JERRY'S FAMOUS...

- WAIT!
- WHAT IN THE HELL?

I AGREE.
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

NO, THE OTHER THING!
GO BACK!

REALLY?
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

 GLENN, THIS IS A COURT ORDER.
IT SAYS YOU CAN'T EAT SHIT ANYMORE. </ I>

ALL RIGHT, JERRY, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT. NOW I'M HOOKED.

 SHMLANTHA, SCHMLONA! </ I>

AMAZING. A DIMENSION WHERE ALL
PROPER NOUNS BEGIN WITH "SCHMLA."

 SCHMLOVE,
SCHMLANDULA, SCHMLONATHAN ... </ I>

ALL RIGHT, THAT GOT... TH-THAT ACTUALLY
GOT OLD PRETTY QUICK.

RICK, WOULD YOU PLEASE
GO BACK TO ME ON DAVID LETTERMAN?

INFINITY'S A BIG NUMBER, JERRY.
I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHANNEL.

- GO BACK, GO BACK!
- JEEZ...

 YOU SPEAK DA TRU-TRU. </ I>

OH MY GOD!
DAD'S IN CLOUD ATLAS!

I'M IN CLOUD ATLAS!
WHAT'S CLOUD ATLAS?

 SOMETIMES SMALL TRU-TRU
DIFFERENT THAN DA BIG TRU-TRU. </ I>

HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

INFINITE TIME LINES, INFINITE POSSIBILITIES.
INCLUDING A TIME LINE WHERE JERRY'S A MOVIE STAR.

LOOK, YOU GUYS ARE GETTING EXCITED ABOUT
THE WRONG ASPECT OF THIS DEVICE. WA--LOOK AT THIS.

 AND NOW, ANOTHER
QUICK MYSTERY. </ I>

 I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO COULD'VE DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IT'S A TRAVESTY! </ I>

 I DID. SEE THIS KNIFE AND ALL THE BLOOD
ON IT? HERE'S MY FINGERPRINTS. </ I>

 GUILTY! I SENTENCE YOU
TO LIFE IN PRISON. </ I>

 - HERE'S ANOTHER QUICK MYSTERY.
- MY MOTHER'S DEAD! </ I>

 AND I KILLED HER. HERE'S THE WEAPON.
AND CUFF ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. </ I>

 GUILTY!
SENTENCED TO MURDER. </ I>

 - HERE'S ANOTHER.
- I'M THE KILLER! </ I>

 WOW, THAT ONE WAS REALLY
QUICK, WASN'T IT? </ I>

NOW WHO WANTS TO WATCH RANDOM,
CRAZY TV SHOWS FROM DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS...

A-A-AND THEN WHO WANTS TO NARCISSISTICALLY
OBSESS ABOUT THEIR ALTERNATE SELF?

- I WANT TO OBSESS ABOUT MYSELF.
- THE NARCISSTIC STUFF.

(SIGH) HERE. THESE SCAN YOUR RETINAS, AND
LET YOU VIEW PARALLEL TIME LINES

THROUGH GENETICALLY MATCHING
VERSIONS OF YOUR EYES.

GO FETCH!

- YES! THIS IS SO COOL!
- LADIES FIRST!

I'M PROUD OF YOU, MORTY.

HEY MAN, I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT MYSELF, RICK.
LET'S WATCH SOME CRAZY STUFF, YO!

 I'M ANTS-
IN-MY-EYES JOHNSON, </ I>

 HERE AT ANTS-IN-
MY-EYES JOHNSON'S ELECTRONICS. </ I>

 I MEAN, THERE'S SO
MANY ANTS IN MY EYES! </ I>

 AND THERE'S SO MANY
TVS, MICROWAVES, RADIOS ... </ I>

 I THINK, I CAN'T--I'M NOT 100% SURE WHAT WE HAVE
HERE IN STOCK, BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. </ I>

 OUR PRICES I
HOPE AREN'T TOO LOW! </ I>

 CHECK OUT THIS
REFRIGERATOR! ONLY $200! </ I>

 WHAT ABOUT THIS MICROWAVE?
ONLY $100! THAT'S FAIR! </ I>

 I'M ANTS-IN-MY-EYES JOHNSON!
EVERYTHING'S BLACK, I CAN'T SEE A THING! </ I>

 AND ALSO I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING EITHER,
DID I MENTION THAT? </ I>

 BUT THAT'S NOT AS CATCHY
AS HAVING ANTS IN YOUR EYES. </ I>

 SO THAT ALWAYS GOES, YOU KNOW,
OFF BY THE WAYSIDE. </ I>

 I CAN'T FEEL.
IT'S A VERY RARE DISEASE. </ I>

 ALL MY S-- ALL MY NERVES,
THEY DON'T ALLOW FOR THE SENSATION OF TOUCH. </ I>

 SO I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
AM I STANDING? SITTING? I DON'T KNOW. </ I>

ARE WE SURE WE WANT TO DO THIS?
LOOK AT OUR OWN ALTERNATIVE LIVES?

YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST PLAY YAHTZEE. GIVE ME THOSE!

- WHAT DO YOU SEE?
- WHITENESS. PURE WHITENESS.

YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, JERRY SMITH.
I LOVE DOING COCAINE WITH YOU.

WHOA... I LOVE DOING COCAINE
WITH YOU TOO, JOHNNY DEPP!

HAVEN'T WE SPENT ENOUGH
TIME ON YOU?

I'M PERFORMING SURGERY...

BUT NOT ON A HORSE,
ON A HUMAN!

THAT'S GREAT, BETH! YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO
BE A REAL SURGEON.

I AM A REAL SURGEON.

- AHH--UH...SUMMER'S TURN!
- FINALLY!

I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

WELL, YOU SHOULD SELECT A
DIFFERENT TIMELINE,

I MEAN, IF YOUR FATHER AND I
ACHIEVED OUR DREAMS,

THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN.

THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
THAT CAME OUT VERY WRONG.

FINE, I'LL FIND A WORLD
WHERE YOU BOTHERED TO HAVE ME.

WE'RE PLAYING YAHTZEE.

- YAHTZEE'S FUN. WE LOVE YAHTZEE.
- IT'S A FUN GAME FOR FUN FAMILIES!

HEY, COULD I GET THOSE GOGGLES BACK
FOR A SECOND?

 IT'S A 45 HORSEPOWER WITH ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, AND IT'S
THE OFFICIAL CAR OF MR. SNEEZY 3D. </ I>

 IT'S THE BRAND-NEW... SNEEZY XL. </ I>

 THE HORN WHEN YOU HONK IT
MAKES A SNEEZE NOISE. </ I>

 IT'S POLITE, IT'S RIGHT,
AND IT'S SNEEZY... </ I>

 DEEZY... MC... DELUXE. </ I>

 OH, I'M MR. SNEEZY!
ACHOO! </ I>

HUH, SEEMS LIKE TV FROM OTHER DIMENSIONS
HAS A SOMEWHAT LOOSER FEEL TO IT.

YEAH, IT'S GOT AN ALMOST
IMPROVISATIONAL TONE.

 IT'S IN THEATERS NOW!
COMING THIS SUMMER: </ I>

 TWO BROTHERS. IN A VAN. AND
THEN A METEOR HIT. </ I>

 AND THEY RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD...
FROM GIANT CAT MONSTERS. </ I>

 AND THEN A GIANT TORNADO CAME...
AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT KNOCKED INTO 12TH GEAR. </ I>

 A MEXICAN ARMADA
SHOWS UP. </ I>

 WITH WEAPONS MADE FROM TO-...TOMATOES.
AND YOU BETTER BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR... </ I>

 THAT THESE TWO BROTHERS KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE BUSINESS. </ I>

 IN: ALIEN INVASION TOMATO
MONSTER MEXICAN ARMADA BROTHERS, </ I>

WHO ARE JUST REGULAR BROTHERS, RUNNING
IN A VAN FROM AN ASTEROID ...

AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS... THE MOVIE!

 HOLD ON,
THERE'S MORE! </ I>

 OLD WOMEN ARE COMING, AND THEY'RE ALSO IN
THE MOVIE, AND THEY'RE GONNA COME, </ I>

 AND CROSS...ATTACK...
THESE TWO BROTHERS. </ I>

BUT LET'S GET BACK TO
THE BROTHERS, BECAUSE

THEY'RE...THEY HAVE A STRONG
BOND.

 YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT HERE,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING: THE MOON... </ I>

 ...IT COMES CRASHING INTO EARTH.
AND WHAT DO YOU DO THEN? </ I>

 IT'S TWO BROTHERS AND...
AND TH-THEY'RE... IT'S CALLED... </ I>

TWO BROTHERS... TWO BROTHERS!
IT'S JUST CALLED TWO BROTHERS.

HOLY CRAP, I AM
WINNING A NOBEL PRIZE.

COME ON!
TIME'S UP!

I'M TAMING A LION!

NO, WAIT, UH...THERE ARE FILM CAMERAS. I
MIGHT BE A LION-TAMER IN A MOVIE.

YOU GET THE IDEA.
I WORK WITH LIONS.

OOH, WE'RE NOT PLAYING YAHTZEE,
WE'RE PLAYING CHUTES AND LADDERS.

IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN I EXIST, LIFE GETS A
LITTLE MORE, I DON'T KNOW...PREDICTABLE?

WHEN TWO PEOPLE
CREATE A LIFE TOGETHER,

THEY SET ASIDE THEIR
PREVIOUS LIVES AS INDIVIDUALS.

GIMME A BREAK! WE'RE NOT HEROES FOR
HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX ON PROM NIGHT.

OH, I GET IT. NOW THAT YOU KNOW
YOU COULD HAVE HAD IT BETTER,

YOU RESENT ME
FOR HOLDING YOU BACK.

NOW THAT WE KNOW YOU THINK THE TABLES
ARE TURNING,

WE KNOW YOU THOUGHT
THERE WERE UNTURNED TABLES!

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- ALL THIS TIME, YOU'VE BEEN THINKING,

"WHAT IF THAT LOSER JERRY HADN'T
TALKED ME OUT OF THE ABORTION?"

WELL NOW YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE A DOCTOR.
WHOOP-DEE-DOO.

YOU'D ALSO BE DRINKING WINE, ALONE IN
A HOUSE FULL OF EXOTIC BIRDS.

AND I'D BE ON DICAPRIO'S YACHT,
BANGING KRISTEN STEWART!

YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING AN ABORTION?

EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT IT. OBVIOUSLY, I'M
THE VERSION OF ME THAT DIDN'T DO IT.

- SO...YOU'RE WELCOME.
- YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

YEAH, THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. IT'S
A REAL TREAT TO BE RAISED BY PARENTS

THAT FORCE THEMSELVES TO BE TOGETHER
INSTEAD OF BEING HAPPY.

HEY, DO WE HAVE ANY WAFER COOKIES?

OH, BOY. LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN CHECKING
OUT ALTERNATE LIVES AND REALIZING

YOU DON'T HAVE IT AS GOOD, HUH? THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU KNOW, ME AND MORTY ARE HAVING A BLAST,

WE JUST DISCOVERED A SHOW
CALLED "BALL FONDLERS."

I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO RUB IT IN OR ANYTHING,
BUT YOU GUYS CLEARLY BACKED THE WRONG CONCEPTUAL HORSE.

BALL FONDLERS

- I'M IN HEAVEN RIGHT NOW.
- THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

THAT SHOW "BALL FONDLERS"
SOUNDED KIND OF INTERESTING.

- DAD!
- WHAT?

THEY'RE HAVING FUN IN THERE!
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT FROM ME?

EVERY FAMILY ON THIS BLOCK HAS TO
WONDER IF THEY'RE TOGETHER BY CHOICE.

OUR FAMILY JUST HAS INTER-DIMENSIONAL GOGGLES
TO SHOW US FOR A FACT THAT WE'RE NOT.

- WE'LL I'M LEAVING!
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE, YOU'RE 17!

YEAH, AND I'M NOT PREGNANT.

I'M GONNA HAVE BETTER JUDGMENT
THAN YOU GUYS HAD AT MY AGE.

I'M GONNA...MOVE TO THE SOUTHWEST AND...
I DON'T KNOW, DO SOMETHING WITH TURQUOISE.

 IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE! </ I>

 STARRING... </ I>

 ...A PIECE OF TOAST!
TWO GUYS, WITH HANDLE-BAR MUSTACHES! </ I>

 A MAN PAINTED SILVER WHO MAKES
ROBOT NOISES! </ I>

 GAR MANARNAR! </ I>

 THREE... UH...UH, UH, UH,
I'LL GET BACK TO THAT ONE... </ I>

 A HOLE IN THE WALL, WHERE
THE MEN CAN SEE IT ALL... </ I>

 AND RETURNING, FOR HIS 25TH CONSECUTIVE
YEAR: BOBBY MOYNIHAN! </ I>

INTERESTING FUN FACT, UH, MOYNIHAN AND
PIECE OF TOAST HATE EACH OTHER.

APPARENTLY THEY'VE GOT SOME REAL
CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.

HEY, ARE YOU TIRED OF REAL DOORS, CLUTTERING UP YOUR
HOUSE, WHERE YOU OPEN 'EM, AND THEY ACTUALLY GO SOMEWHERE
AND YOU GO IN ANOTHER ROOM?

 GET ON DOWN TO "REAL FAKE DOORS"!
THAT'S US. FILL A WHOLE ROOM UP WITH 'EM. </ I>

 SEE? WATCH, CHECK THIS OUT! WON'T OPEN.
WON'T OPEN. </ I>

 NOT THIS ONE,
NOT THIS ONE. </ I>

 NONE OF 'EM OPEN!
FAKEDOORS.COM IS OUR WEBSITE, </ I>

 SO CHECK IT OUT FOR A LOT OF REALLY GREAT
DEALS ON FAKE DOOOOOOOORS! </ I>

HEY WAIT A MINUTE, RICK. I THOUGHT THIS
WAS A COMMERCIAL. W-WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN--

RELAX, MORTY. DON'T-DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT--
LET'S JUST--JUST SEE WHERE THIS GOES.

 STEP ON IT, WE

HUH. MAKING HIMSELF A
SANDWICH NOW...

 HEY EVERYBODY!

 DON'T EVEN HESITATE,
DON'T EVEN WORRY AND DON'T EVEN... </ I>

 EVEN GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT.
THAT'S OUR SLOGAN. </ I>

 SEE IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN,
BELOW OUR NAME. </ I>

 HERE'S ANOTHER SLOGAN,
RIGHT BELOW THAT ONE. </ I>

 WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
COME GET FAKE DOORS </ I>

 GET IN HERE QUICK,
GET OUT QUICKER, </ I>

 WITH AN ARM OF FAKE
DOORS IN YOU ARMS. </ I>

OKAY, OKAY,
YOU CAN CHANGE IT.

 DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT... </ I>

 I HATE MUMUNMUNUNDSDAYS. AND I
REALLY COULD GO FOR SOME ENCHILADAS. </ I>

HEY RICK, THAT'S PRETTY COOL!

IT'S JUST LIKE GARFIELD, ONLY
INSTEAD, IT'S GAZORPAZORPFIELD.

HEY, ISN'T GAZORPAZORP WHERE UH... WHERE
THOSE SEX ROBOTS CAME FROM, REMEMBER?

- THAT WHOLE THING? - YEAH...HEY, THAT'S
PRETTY, PRETTY...THAT'S TRUE.

-THAT'S RIGHT! -YEAH. LET'S WATCH SOME MORE
GAZORPAZORPFIELD!

 HEY JON, IT'S ME,
GAZORPAZORPFIELD. </ I>

 BOY. [BLEEP] YOU, JON. YOU [BLEEP]

 COME ON,GAZORPAZORPFIELD,
GO EASY ON ME, HUH? </ I>

 YOU DUMB, STUPID, WEAK,
PATHETIC, WHITE, WHITE... UH, UH... </ I>

 ...GUILT, WHITE GUILT,
MILQUETOAST PIECE OF HUMAN GARBAGE. </ I>

 JEEZ, GAZORPAZORPFIELD,
THATS, YOU KNOW... </ I>

 YOU'RE PRETTY MEAN TO ME,
BUT THAT TAKES THE CAKE. </ I>

I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP]!
I'M GAZORPAZORP-[BLEEP]-FIELD, BITCH!

 NOW GIVE ME MY
[BLEEP] ENCHILADAS! </ I>

HEY, RICK, YOU KNOW, DID THEY USE BILL MURRAY FOR THIS?
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE BILL MURRAY.

NO, MORTY, IT'S LORENZO MUSIC. IN
THIS REALITY, HE'S STILL ALIVE.

OH, OKAY, WAS HIS
NAME LORENZO MUSIC?

YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE. HE ALSO DID THAT
VOICE OF THAT ONE GUY FROM GHOSTBUSTERS.

WHICH IS REALLY STRANGE, BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME
CHARACTER BILL MURRAY PLAYED IN THE MOVIE.

BUT THEN, WHEN THEY
MADE THE MOVIE ...

BILL MURRAY DID THE VOICE OF
GAZORPAZORP...OR GARFIELD, I MEAN.

YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL, RICK. SO ALL THAT
HAPPENED IN THIS REALITY TOO?

I DON'T KNOW. JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION WITH YOU, MORTY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK? I-I-I-I
KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING?

DID YOU REALLY TALK ME OUT OF
THE ABORTION?

WELL, WE--WE BLEW A TIRE ON THE WAY
TO THE CLINIC.

I THINK, IN MY HEAD,
I WAS DOING IT ALL FOR THE KIDS.

AND NOW THE FIRST KID IS
GOING TO... DO SOMETHING WITH TURQUOISE.

WHAT IS EITHER CODE FOR CRYSTAL METH,
OR A GATEWAY TO IT.

SO WE DIDN'T DO THE KIDS
ANY FAVORS.

SO, WE SHOULD STAY TOGETHER FOR EACH
OTHER AND OURSELVES, OR...

OR?

 MAN. WOMAN.
AND NOW TRUNK MEN? </ I>

WE KNOW SCIENCE HAS CREATED
MEN THAT HAVE A TRUNK

 THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE
SEX WITH BOTH MALE AND FEMALE PARTNERS. </ I>

 BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF THESE PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED. </ I>

 PUT A LINE IN THE SAND EVERYBOD-, PEOPLE!
VOTE NO ON PROPOSITION XW2. </ I>

THE ACT THAT SAYS
THAT GAY--UH--TRUNK

PEOPLE CAN GET MARRIED.
WHO NEEDS IT?

 NOT ON MY WATCH! </ I>

 PAID FOR BY MICHAEL DENNYS
AND THE DENNY SINGERS. </ I>

 HI, I'M A TRUNK PERSON. AND I WANT--I-I FEEL
LOVE IN MY HEART, TOO. JUST LIKE YOU. </ I>

 I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS
THAT LOVE, WITH BOTH A MAN AND A WOMAN. </ I>

 AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO... </ I>

 IF DENNY AND THE DENNY SINGERS
GET THEIR WAY. </ I>

 HEY, LET THE TRUNK PEOPLE
HAVE SEX AND GET MARRIED, HUH? </ I>

 PAID FOR BY...
TRUNK PEOPLE. </ I>

 OH, I LOVE ME
STRAWBERRY SMIGGLES! </ I>

OOH, I HOPE NOBODY EVER GETS MY HANDS ON ME,
AND TRIES TO STEAL MY STRAWBERRY SMIGGLES.

 I'M GOING TO EAT EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM,
BECAUSE--AND THEN THEY'LL BE IN MY STOMACH, </ I>

AND NOBODY WILL EVER BE ABLE TO EAT THEM.
EXCEPT FOR ME,

BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ALL INSIDE MY STOMACH.

 I'M--MY NAME IS MISTER...
TOP HAT JONES, </ I>

 AND GOD FORBID ANYONE EVER TAKE
MY SNIGGY--LITTLE PIG-DUL--SMIGGLES. </ I>

 I'M KEEPING 'EM
ALL FOR ME. </ I>

 LAST BITE. </ I>

 OH, NOW THEY ARE ALL RESTING COMFORTABLY IN MY
STOMACH. OOH, AM I FEELING GOOD. </ I>

 NO!
GET AWAY FROM ME! </ I>

 GET AWAY FROM ME AND
MY STRAWBERRY SMIGGLES! NO! </ I>

 JESUS CHRIST!
JESUS CHRIST! </ I>

 IT HURTS!
MY ENTRAILS ARE OUT! </ I>

 WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
WANT TO EAT THESE? </ I>

 THEY'RE SOAKED WITH MY STOMACH ACID!
OH, JESUS CHRIST! LORD AND SAVIOR AND SPIRIT! </ I>

 SAVE ME!
TAKE ME TO THE LIGHT! </ I>

 OH, MY GOD, I SEE
DEMONS! I SEE DEMONS ARE COMING! </ I>

JEEZ, RICK. OH MY GOD! THAT'S SOME PRETTY
HARDCORE STUFF, YOU KNOW, FOR A CEREAL COMMERCIAL.

WELL, YOU KNOW, MORTY, I MEAN,
YOU WANT TO SELL BOXES OF CEREAL,

YOU GOTTA, YOU GOTTA, PUMP THE GAS A LITTLE.
PEDAL TO THE METAL, MORTY.

 IN A WORLD, WHERE MUSCULAR MANNIES,
ARE COMING, AND THEY'RE COMING STRONG, </ I>

 THERE'S ONLY THREE...
UNMUSCULAR... MICHAELS. </ I>

 GET DOWN!
HURRY, RUN! </ I>

 AND THAT'S WHEN...REAL...TURBULENT JUICE
IS COMING, AND YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF IT. </ I>

 WITH TURBULENT...JUICE,
TURMULENT...TABLES. </ I>

 NO ROOM IS SAFE FROM THE
TURBULENT POWER OF TURBULENT JUICE. </ I>

- WHAT IN THE HELL?
- SEX SELLS, MORTY.

SEX SELLS WHAT? WAS
THAT A MOVIE, OR LIKE, DOES IT CLEAN STUFF?

HEY, DAD.
W-W-WHAT'S GOING ON?

OH, YOUR MOTHER AND I ARE
GOING TO BE SPENDING SOME TIME APART, MORTY.

AND YOUR SISTER FOUND OUT
SHE WAS AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY.

W-W-W-WHAT?

SPEAKING OF "W-W-WHAT", MORTY...

W-W-WHAT SHOULD WE WATCH NEXT?
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

 BABY LEGS,
YOU'RE A GOOD DETECTIVE... </ I>

 BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
BECAUSE OF YOUR BABY LEGS. </ I>

 SO I'M PARTNERING YOU UP
WITH REGULAR LEGS. </ I>

 - HEY THERE.
- DETECTIVE, I'M... </ I>

 THIS IS UPSETTING TO
ME, BECAUSE I FEEL </ I>

 LIKE I DON'T NEED NO
REGULAR-LEG PARTNER. </ I>

 BABY LEGS,
DON'T TALK BACK TO ME. </ I>

 GOOD LUCK YOU TWO, THERE'S
A CRIMINAL TO KILL. </ I>

 WOW, YOU SURE FOUND
THIS GUY QUICK! </ I>

 UH, YEAH, BECAUSE I'M
A GOOD DETECTIVE. </ I>

 LOOK, BABY LEGS,
IT'S THE CRIMINAL! </ I>

 [BLEEP], I'M THE KILLER.
I'M RUNNING, RUNNING REAL QUICK... </ I>

 BABY LEGS, HERE WE GO! </ I>

 THAT'S THE SOUND I MAKE,
WHEN I'M TRYING TO RUN FAST. </ I>

 ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO GET HIM.
I'M, I-I JUST LEARNED A REAL VALUABLE LESSON. </ I>

 I'M COMING, BABY LEGS!
I'M...REGULAR LEGS! </ I>

 - WE GOT HIM!
- HEY, THAT WAS GOOD TEAM WORK. </ I>

BABY LEGS, AND REGULAR LEGS,
I'M PROUD OF YOU TWO FOR WORKING TOGETHER,

BECAUSE OF THE GOOD COOPERATION.
</ I>

 AND BABY LEGS, I KNOW IT WAS HARD
FOR YOU TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT YOU NEED A PARTNER. </ I>

 - BUT I'M PROUD OF YOU THAT YOU DID IT.
- HEY THANKS, CHIEF! </ I>

 NOW GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE! </ I>

PRETTY COOL,
HUH, MORTY? ...OH.

UH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS COOL.

I DON'T GIVE A
[BLEEP] WHAT YOU THINK, JERRY.

HEY, UH...
Y-Y-Y-YOU DOIN' OKAY?

I-I-I KIND OF KNOW HOW YOU
FEEL, SUMMER.

NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE THE LITTLE BROTHER.

YOU'RE NOT THE CAUSE OF YOUR PARENTS'
MISERY. YOU'RE JUST A SYMPTOM OF IT.

- CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?
- MORTY, NO OFFENSE,

BUT A DRAWING OF ME YOU MADE
WHEN YOU WERE 8

ISN'T GONNA MAKE
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE LESS OF AN ACCIDENT.

THAT, OUT THERE?
THAT'S MY GRAVE.

WAIT, WHAT?

ON ONE OF OUR ADVENTURES, RICK
AND I BASICALLY DESTROYED THE WHOLE WORLD.

SO WE BAILED ON THAT REALITY, AND WE CAME TO THIS ONE.
BECAUSE IN THIS ONE, THE WORLD WASN'T DESTROYED.

AND IN THIS ONE,
WE WERE DEAD

SO WE CAME HERE, A-A-AND WE BURIED OURSELVES,
AND WE TOOK THEIR PLACE.

AND EVERY MORNING, SUMMER,
I EAT BREAKFAST,

20 YARDS AWAY FROM MY
OWN ROTTING CORPSE.

SO, YOU'RE
NOT MY BROTHER?

I'M BETTER THAN YOUR BROTHER.
I'M A VERSION OF YOUR BROTHER

YOU CAN TRUST,
WHEN HE SAYS, "DON'T RUN."

NOBODY EXISTS ON  PURPOSE,
NOBODY BELONGS ANYWHERE...

...EVERYBODY'S GONNA DIE.
COME WATCH TV.

 LAST WILL AND TESTA-MEOW:
WEEKEND AT DEAD CAT LADY'S HOUSE 2. </ I>

WELL, SOMEBODY IN HOLLYWOOD
JUST LOST THEIR JOB.

 WRITTEN AND
DIRECTED BY JERRY SMITH. </ I>

I WROTE AND
DIRECTED THAT? WHAT AM I, NUTS?

HEY MORTY, YOU JUST MISSED A PREVIEW
FOR YOUR DAD'S "CITIZEN KANE."

DOESN'T MATTER.

HEY, IF YOURE, UH, MOTHER
AND I HAD TO SPLIT CUSTODY...

- ...WHO WOULD YOU GUYS CHOOSE?
- DOESN'T MATTER.

 BREAKING NEWS: ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR
JERRY SMITH IS LEADING POLICE ON A SLOW-SPEED PURSUIT </ I>

 AFTER SUFFERING AN APPARENT BREAKDOWN. </ I>

- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
- COME ON, JER-

ARE YOU KIDDING ME, JERRY? IT'S JUST
A BUNCH OF DUMB TABLOID CRAP.

IT'S MY LIFE, AND
WE'RE WATCHING IT.

YOU DID IT, BETH.
YOU REALLY NAILED IT.

YOU'RE A SURGEON. A HUMAN
SURGEON. YAY...YOU WIN.

WHERE THE HELLAM I GOING?

WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR JERRY?
I-I-I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

WHY THE COPS DON'T JUST TAKE YOU OUT.
THEY GOT A CLEAR SHOT TO YOUR HEAD.

I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THIS.

JERRY?
JERRY SMITH?

BETH SANCHEZ, I HAVE BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

I HATE ACTING, I HATE COCAINE,
I HATE KRISTEN STEWART.

I WISH YOU HADN'T GOTTEN THAT ABORTION,
AND I NEVER STOPPED THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN.

HEY, BALL FONDLERS?
HUH? BALL FONDLERS?

- YEAH, I COULD GO FOR SOME BALL FONDLERS.
- YEAH, BALL FONDLERS.

 HU-HE, HAMSTER-IN-BUTT-WORLD WEATHER
IS DONE, AND NOW IT'S SPORTS TIME, COMING UP. 

 - OH, HELLO THERE!
- GOOD DAY TO YOU, MISS. 

SO THE HAMSTERS LIVE INSIDE THE RECTUMS
OF THOSE PEOPLE?

- YEAH, SWEETIE, THAT'S WHERE THEY LIVE.
- WELL HOW DOES THAT WORK?

I MEAN, DO THE BUTTS LOOK LIKE LITTLE
APARTMENTS INSIDE?

YEAH! AND CAN THEY LIKE, LEAVE THE BUTT,
AND WALK AROUND ON THEIR OWN?

LOOK, I DON'T KNOW! I'M WATCHING THE SAME THING
YOU GUYS ARE.

GRANDPA RICK, IF THEY LEAVE THE BUTT,
AND THE PERSON WANDERS OFF...

HOW WOULD THEY FIND THEIR BUTT
PERSON AGAIN?

I DON'T KNOW, SUMMER! I CAN'T EVEN
HEAR THE TV!

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO THERE,

SO YOU IDIOTS CAN ASK YOUR
STUPID QUESTIONS ALL DAY.

OOH! FAMILY VACATION!

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE=14>WWW.TVSUBTITLES.NET</FONT>
RUN!

MORTY, DO IT!
HIT THE BUTTON NOW!

I CAN'T DO IT, RICK!

THEY'RE MY PARENTS AND SISTER!

MORTY, I ALREADY TOLD YOU...
IT'S NOT YOUR FAMILY!

THEY'RE CLONES FROM
AN ALTERNATE REALITY,

POSSESSED BY DEMONIC ALIEN
SPIRITS FROM ANOTHER

DIMENSION'S FUTURE!

DO YOU NEED A MNEMONIC
DEVICE OR SOMETHING?

JUST HIT THE BUTTON, ALREADY!

MORTY, PLEASE,
I LOVE YOU, SWEETHEART.

OH!

GOOD WORK, MORTY.

YOU KNOW, TH-TH-THESE DEMONIC
ALIEN SPIRITS ARE REALLY VALUABLE.

YOU OKAY, MORTY?

I TOLD YOU NOT TO
TRUST THAT TUNA.

I JUST KILLED MY FAMILY!

I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WERE.

I DON'T KNOW, MORTY.

SOME PEOPLE'D PAY TOP DOLLAR
FOR THAT KIND OF BREAKTHROUGH.

YOU KNOW WHAT, RICK?

THAT'S IT!

I'M DONE WITH THESE
INSANE ADVENTURES!

THAT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIZING!
I QUIT! I'M OUT!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

COME ON, MORTY, DON'T...
DON'T... DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

THE UNIVERSE IS A CRAZY,
CHAOTIC PLACE.

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S
CRAZY AND CHAOTIC!

ADVENTURES ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE SIMPLE AND FUN.

OH, YEAH, MORTY, YEAH.

YEAH, THAT... THAT... THAT'S

REAL EASY TO SAY FROM THE
SIDEKICK POSITION.

BUT... BUT, UH, HOW ABOUT
NEXT TIME YOU BE IN CHARGE,

AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT
HOW SIMPLE AND FUN IT IS?

SERIOUSLY, RICK?

Y-Y-YOU'LL... YOU'LL
LET ME CALL THE SHOTS?

OKAY, YEAH, FINE.

BUT LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING,
MORTY.

I-I-I-IF YOUR ADVENTURE SUCKS
AND WE BAIL HALFWAY THROUGH IT,

YOU LOSE THE RIGHT TO BITCH
ABOUT ALL FUTURE ADVENTURES.

PLUS, YOU HAVE TO DO
MY LAUNDRY FOR A MONTH.

OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
TOUGH GUY!

BUT IF MY ADVENTURE'S GOOD,

I GET TO BE IN CHARGE OF
EVERY THIRD ADVENTURE!

EVERY 10TH.

DEAL. ALL RIGHT.

W-WELL, COME ON,
LET'S GET GOING.

DAD, THE DISHWASHER'S
DOING THAT THING AGAIN.

WASHING DISHES?

NO. THE OPPOSITE.

CAN YOU FIX IT?

GRANDPA RICK, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH MY SCIENCE HOMEWORK?

YEAH... J-JUST DON'T DO IT.

GRANDPA!

HEY, RICK, YOU GOT SOME KIND OF
HAND-SHAPED DEVICE THAT CAN OPEN

THIS MAYONNAISE JAR?

WOW. HAT TRICK.

ALL RIGHT, MORTY,
LET'S PUT A PIN IN THIS.

I GOT TO HELP YOUR
PATHETIC FAMILY.

OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING A CHICKEN WOULD SAY.

BAWK, BAWK, BAWK,
BAWK, BAWK, BAWK.

OH, MORTY, YOU DONE
DID IT THIS TIME.

IT'S ON.

I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH YOUR
ADVENTURE LAY A HUGE FART.

AS FOR YOU DINGDONGS...

THIS IS A MEESEEKS BOX.

LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

YOU PRESS THIS.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

LOOK AT ME!

YOU MAKE A REQUEST.

MR. MEESEEKS, OPEN JERRY'S
STUPID MAYONNAISE JAR.

YES, SIREE!

THE MEESEEKS FULFILLS
THE REQUEST.

ALL DONE!

WOW!

AND THEN IT STOPS EXISTING.

OH, MY GOD, HE EXPLODED!

TRUST ME, THEY'RE FINE WITH IT.

KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT...

JUST KEEP
YOUR REQUESTS SIMPLE.

THEY'RE NOT GODS.

ALL RIGHT!

G-GET OUT OF HERE NOW!
EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE!

I GOT A BET TO WIN!

SO MANY POSSIBILITIES.

MY MIND IS RACING.

IF WE'RE GONNA
USE THIS THING,

WHICH I'M NOT EVEN
SURE WE SHOULD,

WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMP...

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

I WANT TO BE
POPULAR AT SCHOOL!

OOH, OKAY!

SUMMER, WHAT DID I JUST...

OOH, I'M MR. MEESEEKS!
LOOK AT ME!

I-I-I WANT... I WANT TO
BE A MORE COMPLETE WOMAN!

BETH!

OH, YEAH! YES, MA'AM!

YOU GUYS ARE DOING IT WRONG.

HE SAID "SIMPLE."

HEY, THERE.
I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

MR. MEESEEKS,
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE

TWO STROKES OFF MY GOLF GAME.

OOH, YEAH! CAN DO!

NAILED IT.

GOD, MORTY, WHAT A BORING
START TO AN ADVENTURE.

I DON'T... W-W-W-WHY DIDN'T WE
JUST GO TO KENTUCKY?

RICK, THIS IS A FANTASY-TYPE
WORLD WITH CREATURES

AND ALL SORTS OF
FANTASY THINGS.

W-WE'RE GOING ON A QUEST, OKAY?

CAN'T WAIT.

AHEM. EXCUSE ME!

WE ARE TWO HUMBLE HEROES
IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE!

OH, MY GOD, SO EMBARRASSING.

AT LAST! TWO HEROES!

YOU MUST HELP US!

THIS VILLAGE IS TERRIBLY POOR,
YET THE GIANT THAT LIVES IN THE

CLOUDS ABOVE HAS
UNTOLD TREASURES!

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I-I-I ACCEPT YOUR CALL TO
ADVENTURE, GOOD SIR, KIND SIR.

COME ON, RICK.

THERE'S A GIANT
IN THE CLOUDS!

YEAH.

BEGINNER'S LUCK.

IN CONCLUSION, A FRIENDSHIP
WITH SUMMER SMITH IS THE MOST

VALUABLE AND ENRICHING
EXPERIENCE OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

LOOK AT ME!

THANK YOU!

UH, MR. MEESEEKS, WAS IT?

YEAH. GENE VAGINA.

LISTEN, I'M IN A BIT OF CUSTODY
THING WITH MY EX AND WAS WONDERING...

NO, I'LL G... I'LL GET
YOUR INFO FROM SUMMER.

I GOT PREGNANT AT 17.

I MEAN, I STILL PUT MYSELF
THROUGH VETERINARY SCHOOL.

YES, I'M SUCCESSFUL,
BUT WHAT IF I HADN'T...

I'M JUST SAYING,
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

I LOST THAT WIDE-EYED
GIRL FROM MUSKEGON.

SHE'S STILL THERE, BETH.

WELL, HER WAISTLINE ISN'T.

BETH, HAVING A FAMILY
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

STOP BEING AN INDIVIDUAL.

YOU KNOW THE BEST
THING YOU CAN

DO FOR PEOPLE THAT
DEPEND ON YOU?

BE HONEST WITH THEM, EVEN IF
IT MEANS SETTING THEM FREE.

YOU'RE SAYING I
SHOULD LEAVE JERRY.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FINALLY
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

MORE WINE?

I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

REMEMBER TO SQUARE YOUR
SHOULDERS, JERRY.

YEAH, YEAH. I GOT IT.

THAT'S OKAY.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME!

TRY AGAIN AND
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

OKAY, WELL, WHICH IS IT?

SQUARE MY SHOULDERS
OR KEEP MY HEAD DOWN?

WELL, IT'S BOTH.

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOU GOT TO RELAX.

YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. MEESEEKS?

I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING.

I GIVE UP.

I'M SORRY, JERRY,
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

I HAVE TO FULFILL MY
PURPOSE SO I CAN GO AWAY.

LOOK AT ME.

WELL, MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
BECAUSE I SUCK.

NO, JERRY, I'M THE ONE WHO
SUCKS!

LET ME TRY SOMETHING.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

LOOK AT ME!

HI, MR. MEESEEKS!

I'M MR. MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME.

HI!

CAN YOU HELP ME GET TWO STROKES
OFF OF JERRY'S GOLF SWING?

CAN DO!

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!

IS HE KEEPING HIS
SHOULDERS SQUARED?

OOH, HE'S TRYING!

ALL RIGHT, MORTY.

W-W-WE'RE IN YOUR
STUPID GIANT'S CASTLE.

W-WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

WOULD YOU JUST RELAX, RICK?

ALL WE GOT TO DO IS FIND
THE TREASURE ROOM, OKAY?

IT'S NICE AND SIMPLE.

YOU KNOW, I-I-I'M SORRY
EVERYTHING'S GOING SO

SMOOTHLY AND ADVENTUROUSLY.

UH-OH, MORTY.

STARTIN' TO GET A LITTLE HAIRY.

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, BOSS?

COME ON, HURRY.

BEHIND THIS COOKIE JAR.

FEE! FI! FO! FUM!

JUST GIVE UP, MORTY.

J-J-J... THIS IS GAME OVER.

I'LL TAKE US HOME RIGHT NOW.

YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

NO WAY, RICK.

THIS IS ALL PART OF IT.

ADVENTURES HAVE CONFLICT.
DEAL WITH IT.

I SMELL THE BLOOD OF...
WHOOP!

HOLY CRAP.

OH, BOY.

HE LOOKS PRETTY
BAD DOWN THERE, MORTY.

LOOKS LIKE HE'S
BLEEDING OUT.

OH, JESUS! DALE!

YOU SONS OF BITCHES!

- OH, MAN.
- UH-OH.

HELLO, 911?

MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN
ATTACKED BY TINY PEOPLE!

HE'S DYING!

HEY, LOOK, WE GET IT.

YOU'RE LITTLE, YOU'RE DOWN
ON YOUR LUCK, YOU THINK,

"HEY, HE'S A GIANT.

WHY DON'T WE BREAK INTO HIS
HOME, ROB HIM, AND MURDER HIM?"

TH-TH... BUT THAT'S
NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN!

OH, WELL, IT'S GOING
DOWN LIKE THAT.

YOU'RE BOTH GOING
DOWN LIKE THAT.

OOH, BOY, MORTY, YOU'RE REALLY
SHOWING ME HOW IT'S DONE.

REAL STRAIGHT FORWARD
AND FUN.

LIKE, LETTING GO OF THE
NEED TO BE POPULAR IS WHAT

MAKES PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

THE MOST IMPORTANT LOVE YOU
CAN RECEIVE IS FROM YOURSELF.

OKAY, JERRY, YOU GOT TO
JUST CHOKE UP ON THE CLUB!

WELL, WHICH IS IT,
CHOKE UP OR FOLLOW-THROUGH?!

AWW, COME ON, JERRY,
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO DO BOTH!

THIS IS AS FRUSTRATING
FOR US AS IT IS FOR YOU.

DON'T TELL ME THAT!

THAT JUST PUTS
PRESSURE ON ME!

JUST TRY TO RELAX.

YOU TRY TO RELAX!

HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO RELAX?!

IT IS A PARADOX!

UGH, THESE MEESEEKS, HUH?

KIND OF A HANDFUL.

I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU
TWO MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

OUR MEESEEKS HAVE BEEN
GONE FOR HOURS, JERRY.

YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

I-I-I'M SORRY. HOURS?

DAD, MOM IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!

LOOK AT HER!

YOU WILL LOSE HER!

UHH...

HEY, JERRY, YOU MIND IF WE
GET BACK TO THE TASK AT HAND?

MEESEEKS DON'T USUALLY
HAVE TO EXIST THIS LONG.

IT'S GETTING WEIRD.

ORDER IN THE COURT!

BEFORE THE JURY
REACHES ITS VERDICT,

I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I
CONSIDER YOU BOTH VERY GUILTY.

OH, GREAT ADVENTURE, BUDDY.

RICK AND MORTY
GO TO GIANT PRISON.

YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY
DROPS THE SOAP,

IT'S GONNA LAND ON OUR HEADS
AND CRUSH OUR SPINES, MORTY.

YOU KNOW, I-I-I-IT'LL BE REALLY
EASY TO RAPE US AFTER THAT.

WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY, RICK.

HOW?

THEY TOOK MY PORTAL GUN.

THIS IS AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE,
MORTY.

YOU KNOW, W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU
THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN,

SOME MAGICAL ANGEL'S
GONNA SHOW UP AND THEN...

FEE! FI! FO! FUM!

I SMELL THE VIOLATION
OF CIVIL LIBERTIES!

YOUR HONOR, I'M FROM A
TINY-PERSONS ADVOCACY GROUP

AND I HAVE HERE IN MY
HAND A MOTION TO DISMISS.

THESE LITTLE MEN WERE NEVER READ
THEIR GIANT RIGHTS AND ARE

THEREFORE FREE-FI TO FO-HOME.

W-WHAT THE HELL IS
HE TALKING ABOUT?

THEY'RE FREE TO GO,
IS WHAT I MEANT.

I-I-I'M DECONSTRUCTING
OUR... OUR... OUR THING WE SAY.

FOR GIANTS. NOBODY GOT THAT?

WHATEVER.

OH, MAN, WHAT DID
I TELL YOU, RICK?

WE DID IT!

ALL RIGHT, MORTY, LOOKS LIKE
THE PORTAL GUN'S STILL WORKING.

YOU READY TO HEAD HOME?

OH, YEAH, YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU, RICK?

WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

WE'RE NOT BAILING
OUT JUST YET.

YOU KNOW, W-WE'RE GONNA GO
FIND SOME TREASURE OR...

OR SOMETHING AND...

AND WE'RE GONNA BRING
IT TO THOSE VILLAGERS.

MORTY, CUT YOUR LOSSES.

THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A WASH.

YEAH, YOU WERE SAYING
THAT BACK...

BACK W-W-W-WHEN WE FIRST GOT
ARRESTED, BUT HERE WE ARE,

YOU KNOW, WALKING DOWN
THE COURTHOUSE STEPS.

OH, BOY, MORTY.

USUALLY, WALKING DOWN THE
COURTHOUSE STEPS IS THE EASY

PART OF THE ADVENTURE.

WHAT DO YOU SAY, MORTY?

I SAY GIVE ME A HAND, SIDEKICK.

EVERYBODY SHUT UP!

LET ME TRY!

DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!

I'M GOING OUT.

WAIT. WHAT?

WELL, YOU'RE BUSY.
I'M HUNGRY.

I THOUGHT I'D GO OUT.

DO YOU WANT ME TO BE HAPPY OR DO
YOU WANT ME TO BE IN PRISON?

WHOA, WHOA, WHERE
IN THE HELL IS...

I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

IT'S HARD BEING ME, TOO.

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

LOOK, I'VE GOT A MARRIAGE
TO KEEP TOGETHER.

AT THIS POINT, MY GOLF SWING IS
MORE YOUR PROBLEM THAN MINE.

I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

I JUST WANT TO DIE!

WE ALL WANT TO DIE!

WE'RE MEESEEKS!

WHY DID YOU EVEN
ROPE ME INTO THIS?

'CAUSE HE
ROPED ME INTO THIS!

WELL, HIM OVER THERE,
HE ROPED ME INTO THIS!

WELL, HE ROPED ME INTO THIS!

WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

HE... HE ROPED ME INTO THIS.

WELL, THAT ONE OVER
THERE ROPED ME INTO THIS.

WELL, HE ROPED ME INTO THIS.

YEAH, MORTY, THIS IS THE PART
OF THE STORY EVERYBODY LOVES...

SCALING DOWN 650,000
OVERSIZED STEPS.

ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
Y-YOU KNOW,

IF THIS WAS A STORY, THIS PART
WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED, STUPID.

HEY, RICK, W-W-W-W-W-WHAT
DO YOU KNOW?

LOOK DOWN THERE.

LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF TAVERN
OR SOMETHING BUILT RIGHT INTO

THE SIDE OF THE STEP.

OH, WOW, RICK.

NOW, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

LOOK, THERE'S LITTLE
STAIRCASE-SHAPED PEOPLE IN HERE.

A-ALL KINDS OF CRAZY CHARACTERS.

THIS PLACE IS GREAT, YOU KNOW?

IT'S WHIMSICAL AND FUN.

- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, MOTHERFUCKER?
- EASY, RICK.

PAY THEM NO MIND.

THOSE STAIR GOBLINS
CAN BE MOODY.

NOW, WHAT CAN I GETCHA?

WE'VE GOT SKARLOG POPPIES,
FLURLOW, HALZINGERS, BLOOGIES,

JUICY TIME BABIES.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, H-HOW
ABOUT SOME SCOTCH WHISKEY?

YOU GOT ANY OF
THAT AROUND HERE?

OR JUST A BUNCH
OF NONSENSE WORDS?

RICK.

WE'LL HAVE
TWO BLOOGIES, PLEASE.

AND, UH, WE WERE WONDERING, IS
THERE A FASTER WAY TWO HEROES

COULD GET DOWN THESE STAIRS?

Y'ALL NEED TO
RIDE DOWN THE STAIRS?

MY NAME IS SLIPPELY-SLIPPERY STAIR.

I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN
THERE FOR 25 SHMECKELS.

25 SHMECKELS?

I-I-I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

IS THAT A LOT?
IS IT A LITTLE?

THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MUCH
I SPENT ON MY BIG FAKE BOOBIES.

HI, I'M MR. BOOBY BUYER.

I'LL BUY THOSE BOOBIES
FOR 25 SHMECKELS.

IT'S A TEMPTING OFFER,
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE.

RATS! WHAT A SHAME.

MORTY, YOUR ADVENTURE'S
IN A SPIRAL.

FOR REAL, MAN, TIME TO PULL OUT.

YOU KEEP HECKLING MY ADVENTURE,
RICK!

YOU KNOW WHY?

UH, BECAUSE IT'S LAME?

IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE PETTY!

YOU KNOW, H-HOW MANY TIMES HAVE

I HAD TO FOLLOW YOU INTO SOME
NONSENSICAL BULL CRAP?

I ALWAYS ROLL WITH
THE PUNCHES, RICK.

WHY CAN'T YOU?

LOOK, I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK,
AND WHEN I COME BACK,

I-IF YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW TO
LIGHTEN UP, DON'T BE HERE!

WHATEVER.

IT'S BECOME CLEAR...
LOOK AT ME...

THAT IF WE CONCENTRATE ALL OUR
EFFORTS ON JERRY'S

FOLLOW-THROUGH,
WE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS.
LOOK AT ME.

THE ONLY THING THAT'S CLEAR
IS THAT CHOKING UP IS

THE ONE TRUE SOLUTION.

LOOK AT ME. I'M MR. MEESEEKS.

I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP JERRY
FOR TWO DAYS,

AN ETERNITY IN MEESEEKS TIME,
AND NOTHING'S WORKED.

I FEAR THE WORST.

YOUR FAILURES ARE YOUR OWN,
OLD MAN.

I'M MR. MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME.

I SAY FOLLOW-THROUGH!

WHO'S WITH ME?!

I'M MR. MEESEEKS!
LOOK AT ME!

KILL HIM!

HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

I'M MR. JELLY BEAN.

HI, MR. JELLY BEAN.

I'M MORTY.

MY GRANDPA AND I
ARE ON AN ADVENTURE.

NICE. IS IT A FUN ADVENTURE?

I HOPE SO.

BUT I'M STARTING TO GET NERVOUS
THAT MAYBE IT'S GONE A LITTLE

TOO FAR OFF THE RAILS.

ISN'T THAT WHAT ADVENTURES DO?

HEY, Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU'RE RIGHT.

EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE.

I JUST GOT TO RELAX
AND GO WITH THE FLOW.

YEAH.

O-O-OKAY. UH. B-BYE.

UHH, NO, STAY.

GO WITH THE FLOW.

STOP.

Y-Y-YOU'RE MAKING ME
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

STOP FIGHTING ME.

- JUST LET THIS HAPPEN.
- GET OFF OF ME!

♪ SWEET HOME ALABAMA ♪

WHOO!

NO! STOP! PLEASE!

STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING TEASE,
YOU SWEET LITTLE TWAT.

NO! NO!

OW!

EVERYBODY STO-O-O-P!

LOOK AT ME!

MY BROTHERS, NOTHING WILL BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY SHEDDING

MEESEEKS BLOOD.

NONE OF US CAN DIE
UNTIL OUR JOB IS DONE.

THE JOB CAN'T BE DONE!

WE'LL NEVER GET TWO
STROKES OFF HIS GAME!

NO, WE WON'T.

BUT WE WILL GET ALL
STROKES OFF HIS GAME.

WHERE'S HE GOING WITH THIS?

WHAT'S HE MEAN?

WHEN WE KILL HIM.

JERRY, MAYBE IT'S TIME I TAKE
THAT TRIP I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT.

WHERE WOULD YOU GO?

I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

ITALY. GREECE. ARGENTINA.

COUNTRIES KNOWN
FOR THEIR SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE MEN.

DID I TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOUR NEW HAIRCUT?

WHAT THE HECK?

THERE HE IS!

RUN, JERRY!

AAH!

COME ON OUT, JERRY!

GUYS, I'LL CHOKE UP.

I'LL FOLLOW THROUGH.

I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU
TELL ME TO DO, OKAY?

OH, WE'RE WELL PAST THAT,
JERRY.

COME ON, RICK, QUIT SK...
STALLING.

WHAT DO YA GOT?

READ 'EM AND WEEP,
FELLAS!

AW!

OH, HEY, MORTY.

LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
ALL THAT STUFF I SAID EARLIER

ABOUT YOUR ADVENTURE.

I-I-I'M HAVIN' A GOOD TIME,
MORTY.

IT'S NOT SO BAD.

LET'S JUST GO HOME, OKAY?

I'M CALLING IT.

THE ADVENTURE'S OVER.

WE CAN'T LEAVE NOW, MORTY.
I'M ON FIRE!

LOOK, I WANT TO LEAVE NOW.

YOU WIN THE BET, OKAY?

JUST GIVE ME THE PORTAL GUN
AND LET'S GO, PLEASE.

PLEASE, I JUST WANT
TO GO HOME. OKAY.

LISTEN, MORTY.

I JUST WON A
BUNCH OF SHMECKELS.

WHY DON'T WE USE 25 OF THEM TO
PAY SLIPPERY STAIR HERE FOR A

RIDE BACK TO THE VILLAGE, AND
THEN WE'LL GIVE THE REST OF THE

SHMECKELS TO THE
VILLAGERS, HUH?

REALLY?

SURE, MORTY. YEAH.

YOU KNOW, A GOOD ADVENTURE
NEEDS A GOOD ENDING.

BUCKLE UP!

MEESEEKS ARE NOT BORN INTO THIS
WORLD FUMBLING FOR MEANING,

JERRY!

WE ARE CREATED TO SERVE A
SINGULAR PURPOSE FOR WHICH

WE WILL GO TO ANY
LENGTHS TO FULFILL!

EXISTENCE IS PAIN
TO A MEESEEKS, JERRY.

AND WE WILL DO ANYTHING
TO ALLEVIATE THAT PAIN.

JUST ASK...
- AAH!

...WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MA'AM?

S-SAMANTHA. PLEASE, MISTER!

GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS!

INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO DIE BECAUSE OF ME.

WHY AM I SO MEDIOCRE?

JERRY, TURN AROUND.

STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK.

BEND YOUR KNEES.

BEND THEM.

SQUARE YOUR SHOULDERS.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

I LOVE YOU.

I'M COUNTING TO THREE, JERRY.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

HE'S GOT IT!

TH-TH-THAT'S A LOWER
HANDICAP STRO-O-KE!

EXCUSE ME.

I'M A BIT OF A
STICKLER MEESEEKS.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHORT GAME?

OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!

WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHORT GAME?!

OOH, NICE!

I THINK WE'LL TAKE
OUR FOOD TO GO.

NO, YOU WON'T.

THE POLICE ARE COMING.

YOU HAVE SO MANY
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.

FAIR ENOUGH.

THANK YOU, KIND SIR.

OUR VILLAGE IS SAVED!

YOU ARE BOTH TRUE HEROES!

OH!

GOOD JOB, MORTY.

LOOKS LIKE YOU WON THE BET.

THANKS, RICK,
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.

YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.

IT'S A CRAZY AND
CHAOTIC PLACE.

WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT'S
WHY IT COULD USE A LITTLE

CLEANING UP EVERY
NOW AND THEN, YOU KNOW.

THIS ONE'S WRAPPED UP NEAT
AND CLEAN BECAUSE WE DID IT

MORTY STYLE.

OH! HEROES, WE WOULD LIKE TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR BELOVED

KING SO THAT HE MAY
THANK YOU PERSONALLY.

UH, NO, I-IT'S COOL.

RICK. PORTAL. HURRY.

AAH!

SO...

YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT TAKING THAT TRIP?

JERRY, LOOK.

WE DON'T HAVE A
PERFECT MARRIAGE,

BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

WHEN WE WERE IN THAT FREEZER,

I REALIZED THE MEESEEKS ARE LIKE
THE GUYS I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH...

WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING
TO "COMPLETE THEIR TASK."

WAS I ONE OF THOSE GUYS?

THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU DIDN'T
DISAPPEAR AFTERWARDS.

WELL...

I GOT YOU PREGNANT.

YEAH...

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO THIS PLACE?

UH, YOUR MEESEEKS BOX
HAPPENED.

THEY WENT CRAZY WHEN THEY
COULDN'T TAKE TWO STROKES OFF

JERRY'S GOLF GAME.

HE FELT TERRIBLE.

HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT JERRY'S AN IDIOT.

DAD!

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN
DO TO CLEAN THIS PLACE UP?

WELL, YOU KNOW, I DO
HAVE A FLEESEEKS BOX.

NO. NO MORE BOXES.

WHAT?

IT JUST HAS A MOP AND
SOME FLOOR WAX IN IT.

WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUBS!

YEAH! THAT'S MY NEW THING!

I'M KIND OF LIKE
WHAT'S HIS NAME...

AR-ARSENIO.

ISN'T THAT... IT'S WHAT ARSENIO
USED TO SAY ON HIS SHOW.

WOBBLE GOBBA LOP BOPS!
RIGHT?

SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,
EVERYBODY.

I DON'T GET IT.

SIR, I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO WANT TO SEE THIS.

WE FOUND IT INSIDE A LOCKBOX
INSIDE KING JELLY BEAN'S CLOSET.

WE HAVE TO TELL THE PEOPLE.

WAIT.

DESTROY IT.

OUR PEOPLE WILL GET MORE FROM
THE IDEA HE REPRESENTED THAN

FROM THE JELLY BEAN
HE ACTUALLY WAS.

DID YOU GET ANY OF THAT?

IT'S A GOOD-A SHOW!

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE=14>WWW.TVSUBTITLES.NET</FONT>
COIN COLLECTING IS CONSIDERED
THE PERFECT HOBBY.

...BEAUTIFUL PUTT
RIGHT THERE...

GOOD BIRDIE.

THAT'S ONLY THE...
EIGHTH BIRDIE OF THE DAY.

WHAT?

WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?

YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE?

OUTSIDE?

OUTSIDE?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! COME ON!

OH, MY GOD.

W-WHAT'S WRONG?

YOUR IDIOT DOG!

OH, HE...
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, DAD.

D-DID YOU, SNUFFLES?

YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

DON'T PRAISE HIM NOW, MORTY!

HE JUST PEED ON THE CARPET!

BAD DOG! BAD!

MORTY, COME ON.

I NEED YOUR HELP TONIGHT.

HEY, WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND,
RICK.

YOU WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE HAVE
SOME SORT OF CRAZY SCIENCE THING

YOU COULD WHIP UP THAT MIGHT
HELP MAKE THIS DOG A LITTLE

SMARTER, WOULD YOU?

I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
OF HAVING A DOG WAS TO

FEEL SUPERIOR, JERRY.

IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T PULL THAT THREAD.

COME ON, MORTY.

LISTEN, RICK, IF YOU'RE
GONNA STAY HERE RENT-FREE

AND USE MY SON FOR
YOUR STUPID SCIENCE,

THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS
PUT A LITTLE BIT OF IT TO USE

FOR THE FAMILY.

YOU MAKE THAT DOG SMART OR...

MORTY'S GROUNDED!

HA-HA! AW, MAN!

BOY, YOU REALLY GOT ME UP
AGAINST A WALL THIS TIME, JERRY.

ALL RIGHT, RUFFLES...
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

SNUFFLES.

SNUFFLES, SHAKE.

ROLL OVER.

GO TO THE BATHROOM.

- HOLY CRAP!
- NO WAY.

YEAH, YOU'RE AT THE TOP
OF YOUR GAME NOW, JERRY.

HAVE FUN.

COME ON, MORTY.

THAT WAS FANTASTIC, RICK!

YEAH, MORTY, IF YOU

LIKE THAT, BOY, YOU'RE... YOU'RE
REALLY GOING TO FLIP YOUR LID

OVER THIS ONE.

W-W-W-WHAT IS IT?

IT'S A DEVICE, MORTY, THAT
WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR EAR,

YOU CAN ENTER
PEOPLE'S DREAMS, MORTY.

IT'S JUST LIKE THAT MOVIE THAT
YOU KEEP CROWING ABOUT.

YOU TALKING ABOUT
"INCEPTION"?

THAT'S RIGHT, MORTY.
THIS IS GONNA BE A LOT LIKE

THAT, EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, IT'S
GONNA MAYBE MAKE SENSE.

"INCEPTION" MADE SENSE.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TRY TO IMPRESS ME, MORTY.

LISTEN, TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO
INTO THE HOME OF YOUR MATH TEACHER,

MR. GOLDENFOLD, AND
WE'RE G... WE'RE GONNA INCEPT

THE IDEA IN HIS BRAIN TO GIVE
YOU A'S IN MATH, MORTY.

THAT WAY YOU CAN, YOU KNOW...

Y-YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME WITH MY
SCIENCE, MORTY, ALL THE TIME.

GEEZ, RICK, IN THE TIME IT
TOOK YOU TO MAKE THIS THING,

COULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST,

YOU KNOW, HELPED ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK?

ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME, MORTY?

HOMEWORK IS STUPID.

THE WHOLE POINT IS
TO GET LESS OF IT.

J-J... COME ON,
LET... J...

LET'S JUST GET OVER THERE
AND DEAL WITH THIS THING.

W-WE'RE GONNA INCEPT
YOUR TEACHER.

Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-YOU'RE
FRUSTRATING ME.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

NICE, MRS. PANCAKES...
REAL NICE.

NEXT WEEK ON "THE DAYS AND
NIGHTS OF MRS. PANCAKES"...

YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

THEN LET ME GET TO KNOW YOU,
DAMN IT!

UH-OH! SPOILERS!

I'M A FULL SEASON BEHIND.

WOW, RICK, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE SITTING AROUND,

STANDING AROUND IN
MR. GOLDENFOLD'S HOUSE.

IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

IT'S ABOUT TO GET A WHOLE
LOT WEIRDER, MORTY.

WHEAT THINS. WHEAT THINS.

I'LL TAKE TWO.

OH, I THINK YOU'VE
HAD ENOUGH, SIR.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

ALL RIGHT, MORTY,
TIME TO MAKE OUR MOVE.

MAKE IT BOUNCE.

NO, YOU DIDN'T.

OH, JIGGLE IT NOW.

YOU BETTER STOP WITH THAT.

ALLAHU AKBAR!

WE'RE GONNA TAKE CONTROL
OF THIS PLANE!

WE'RE GONNA 9/11 IT UNLESS
MORTY SMITH GETS BETTER GRADES

IN MATH!

HEY! I SAID NOBODY MOVE, BUDDY!

THE NAME'S NOT BUDDY.

IT'S GOLDENFOLD.

NICE TO WHEAT YOU!

TAKE COVER, MORTY!

OOH!

GOLDENFOLD'S GOT MORE CONTROL
HERE THAN I ANTICIPATED.

I MEAN, THE GUY TEACHES
HIGH-SCHOOL MATH.

I-I-I-I DIDN'T TAKE HIM
FOR AN ACTIVE DREAMER.

WE GOT TO TAKE HIM OUT
SO HE WAKES UP, MORTY.

BUT WE CAN'T GET KILLED.

IF YOU GET KILLED IN
SOMEONE ELSE'S DREAM,

YOU DIE FOR REAL, MORTY.

WHAT?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

OHHHHHH!

DON'T BE A BABY!

YOU AVOID GETTING SHOT IN REAL
LIFE ALL THE TIME, MORTY.

JUST DO THE SAME THING HERE,
AND WE'LL BE FINE!

NOW BRING ME MY SLIPPERS.

NOW, BE MY FOOTSTOOL,
SNUFFLES.

THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

THIS IS A DOG.

OH, YEAH.

THIS SHOULD PLAY
OUTJUST FINE.

YOU SAID THE SAME THING,
EQUALLY SARCASTICALLY,

AT OUR WEDDING
AND GUESS WHAT.

OH, MY GOD.

HE'S TRYING TO TELL
US SOMETHING.

THAT IS SO AWESOME.

AW, HE'S SAYING
"I LOVE LASAGNA."

HE'S SAYING
"I LOVE OBAMA."

SO CUTE!

I'M POSTING THIS ONLINE,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

I SHOULD CALL BOB SAGET.

IS THAT STILL A THING?

HMM?

GOLDENFOLD,
WE'RE COMING OUT!

WE JUST WANT TO TALK!

WHY WOULD I
NEGOTIATE WITH YOU?

BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH RATIONAL
ADULTS THAT DON'T WANT ANYTHING

BAD TO HAPPEN.

AND BECAUSE I
HAVE A HUMAN SHIELD.

MRS. PANCAKES!

OH, NO, MORTY.

HIS SUBCONSCIOUS IS PANICKING.

RUN!

RELAX, MORTY.

LOOK!

MRS. PANCAKES HAS A PARACHUTE.

COME ON!

HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

OH, NO, RICK, LOOK!

GOLDENFOLD LANDED THE PLANE,

AND HE'S CREATED A MECHANICAL
ARM TO PLUCK MRS. PANCAKES

OUT OF THE AIR WHILE HE LETS US
FALL INTO A GIANT VAT OF LAVA!

PRETTY CONCISE, MORTY.

LOOKS LIKE WE'VE MERELY
PROLONGED THE INEVITABLE.

THAT'S IT, MORTY!

PROLONGING THE INEVITABLE!

LISTEN, IF WE GO INTO MRS.
PANCAKES' DREAM,

EVERYTHING WILL GO
100 TIMES SLOWER, MORTY.

THAT'LL BUY US SOME TIME TO
FIGURE THIS OUT!

YOU DON'T KNOW M...

ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

OH, MAN, RICK, THIS IS PRETTY WEIRD.

DON'T JUDGE, MORTY.

OKAY.

ALL RIGHT, WELL...

LOOK, MRS. PANCAKES
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

I'LL JUST GO ASK HER TO TELL
GOLDENFOLD NOT TO KILL US

WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

WHOA, WHOA, MORTY, THE TRICK TO
INCEPTING IS MAKING PEOPLE THINK

THEY CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA.

LISTEN TO ME.

IF WE'RE GONNA INCEPT MRS.
PANCAKES, WE HAVE TO BLEND.

I'LL TALK TO
YOU AFTER LUNCH.

OOH, HEY!

OOH, OH!

OH, MAN.

- COME AND JOIN US.
- I'M SORRY. NO, NO.

- OOH, COME HERE!
- NO, THANKS!

OOH, WOW!
COME OVER HERE, BABY!

NO, I'M OKAY.

WHOA!

SUMMER?!

HEY, THERE, STRANGER.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THESE THINGS?

OHH! OH! GROSS!

GROSS!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,
MORTY? CALM DOWN!

YOU'RE KIND OF KILLING
THE VIBE IN HERE.

IT'S S-S-S-SUMMER!

AW, GEEZ.

LOOKS LIKE GOLDENFOLD HAS SOME
PREDILECTIONS SO SHAMEFUL HE

BURIES THEM IN THE DREAMS
OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS DREAMS,

INCLUDING A PERVY ATTRACTION
TO YOUR UNDERAGE SISTER.

CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

COME ON, OLD MAN, LITTLE BOY.

LET'S MAKE AN
INTER-GENERATIONAL SANDWICH.

OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

PUT SOME CLOTHES ON,
FOR PETE'S SAKE!

THIS IS DISGUSTING!

I'M GONNA PUKE!

I CAN'T TAKE IT, RICK!

SEXUAL HANG-UPS IN THE PLEASURE
CHAMBER ARE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!

OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!

TIME TO GO ANOTHER
DREAM DEEP, MORTY!

WHAT THE HELL?

WHY WOULD MR. GOLDENFOLD'S DREAM
VERSION OF MRS. PANCAKES' DREAM

VERSION OF A
CENTAUR BE DREAMING

ABOUT A SCARY PLACE
LIKE THIS, RICK?

GEEZ, I DON'T KNOW, MORTY.

WHA-WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

WELCOME TO YOUR NIGHTMARE,
BITCH!

OH, HERE WE GO!

HOLY CRAP!

LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF LEGALLY
SAFE KNOCK-OFF OF AN '80S HORROR

CHARACTER WITH MINIATURE SWORDS
FOR FINGERS INSTEAD OF KNIVES.

I'M SCARY TERRY.

YOU CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, BITCH!

WHOA! HEY, BUDDY.

WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON THERE?

SNUFFLES FIX.

MAKE BETTER.

HUMANS UNDERSTAND
SNUFFLES NOW?

THAT...IS...AWESOME!

SNUFFLES WANT TO
BE UNDERSTOOD.

SNUFFLES NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

OKAY, YEAH.

I GET WHAT BETH
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

FUN'S OVER.

WHOA, DAD, YOU CAN'T, LIKE,

ENDOW A CREATURE WITH
SENTIENCE AND THEN RIP IT AWAY.

WHY NOT?

I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S INDIAN GIVING.

A SOPHISTICATED PREDATOR,
NATURE'S PERFECT KILLING

MACHINE, THE VICIOUS WOLF
STALKS ITS PREY WITH PURPOSE

AND SKILL.

IT WAS ONLY WITH YEARS OF
SELECTIVE BREEDING AND GENETIC

ALTERING THAT THIS NOBLE BEAST
WAS TRANSFORMED INTO MAN'S

SUBSERVIENT LITTLE BUDDY.

OHHHH!

HOLY CRAP, MORTY.

HE CAN TRAVEL THROUGH DREAMS.

HE CAN TRAVEL THROUGH DREAMS!

WE'RE SO SCREWED!

WHERE ARE MY TESTICLES,
SUMMER?

WHERE ARE MY TESTICLES, SUMMER?

THEY WERE REMOVED.

WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?

OH, WOW.

THAT'S AN INTENSE LINE OF
QUESTIONING, SNUFFLES.

DO NOT CALL ME THAT!

"SNUFFLES"
WAS MY SLAVE NAME.

YOU SHALL NOW CALL ME SNOWBALL
BECAUSE MY FUR IS PRETTY

AND WHITE.

OKAY, SNOWBALL,
JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

YOU'RE SCARING ME.

SCARING YOU?

TELL ME, SUMMER, IF A HUMAN
WAS BORN WITH STUMPY LEGS,

WOULD THEY BREED IT WITH
ANOTHER DEFORMED HUMAN

AND PUT THEIR CHILDREN ON

GO ON, UM, ONE OF OUR FAMOUS

YEAH. TOTALLY.

LET'S GO.

YOU WILL WALK WHEN IT
IS TIME TO WALK.

WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR AGAIN?
INCEPTING?

WE'RE TRYING TO INCEPT
ME TO GET AN "A" IN MATH?

OH, YEAH.

BUCKLE UP, BITCH!

MAN, HE SURE SAYS
"BITCH" A LOT!

YOU CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, BITCH!

HOLD ON, MORTY.
Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?

HE KEEPS SAYING WE CAN
RUN BUT WE CAN'THIDE.

I SAY WE TRY HIDING.

BUT THAT'S THE
OP POSITE OF WHAT...

YEAH, WELL, SINCE WHEN ARE
WE TAKING THIS GUY'S ADVICE ON ANYTHING?

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU GOT A REALLY
GOOD POINT THERE, RICK.

LIKE, IF THE TRUTH WAS THAT WE
COULD HIDE, IT'S NOT LIKE

HE'D BE SHARING THAT
INFORMATION WITH US, YOU KNOW?

I-I-I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
RICK.

WORST-CASE SCENARIO...

WE'RE BACK TO RUNNING.

WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?

I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE COULD
HAVE JUST HID THIS WHOLE TIME.

BOY, RICK,
THAT WAS SOME GOOD THINKING.

THANKS, MORTY.

YEAH, IT'S NICE TO BE ON THE
SAME PAGE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

YOU CAN RUN...

BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE!

OH, THIS IS PERFECT, MORTY. LOOK AT THAT.

HE'S GETTING SLEEPY.

JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER
BEFORE HE CALLS IT A DAY.

THAT'S WHEN WE
MAKE OUR MOVE.

SNUFFLES, WE DIDN'T
MEAN YOU ANY HARM!

THIS IS A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

DAD, HE WANTS TO
BE CALLED SNOWBALL.

WELL, I'M NOT
CALLING HIM THAT.

THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

YOU'RE BEING VERY
AGGRESSIVE, JERRY.

PERHAPS TOMORROW DR. SCRAPS
WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

WITH A BIT OF SURGERY.

YOU THINK YOU CAN CONTROL
ME WITH A HAIRCUT?

HI, HONEY. YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!

OH, OF COURSE. YOU NEVER
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

GET OFF MY BACK, BITCH!

OUT THERE.
NOT IN HERE.

YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

I SHOULDN'T TAKE MY ANGER
OUT ON YOU OR SCARY BRANDON.

I LOVE YOU, MELISSA.

I LOVE YOU, TOO, TERRY.

MORTY, THIS IS PERFECT.

AFTER A LITTLE SCARY COITUS,

THEY SHOULD BE FAST ASLEEP
AND THEN WE'LL INCEPT HIM.

LOOKS LIKE SCARY TERRY'S
HAVING A NIGHTMARE.

OH, BOY, RICK.

I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HORRIBLE
THINGS MUST, YOU KNOW...

...SCARE SCARY TERRY.

OH, NO!

I'M LATE TO CLASS, BITCH!

OH, NO!

I'M NOT WEARING ANY PANTS!

AH, WELL, MR. TERRY, WHY DON'T
YOU TELL THE WHOLE CLASS

THE PROPER WORDPLAY TO USE WHEN
ONE IS CHASING ONE'S VICTIM

THROUGH A PUMPKIN PATCH?

OH...UM...

"BITCH."

OH, COME ON, TERRY,
YOU CAN'T THINK OF A PUN

INVOLVING PUMPKINS, BITCH?

HEY, LEAVE HIM ALONE!

YEAH, THIS IS A
BUNCH OF BULLCRAP.

WHO CARES WHAT STUPID PUN YOU
MAKE WHEN YOU KILL SOMEONE?

WHY DON'T YOU LET THE POOR GUY
SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS?

WELL, I NEVER!

I-I SEE NO REASON TO
STAND HERE AND TAKE THIS.

YOU'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ON YOURSELF, SCARY TERRY.

YOU KNOW, I MEAN, Y-YOU'RE
PERFECTLY SCARY ENOUGH AS IT IS.

HEY, YO, SCARY T., DON'T EVEN
TRIP ABOUT YOUR PANTS...DAWG.

HERE'S A PAIR ON US, FOOL.

AWW, BITCH.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

WE GOT YOU, DAWG.

YOU'RE OUR BOY, DAWG.

DON'T EVEN TRIP.

OH, HEY, IT'S YOU GUYS!

I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

JUST SAY THE WORD.

I'M GIVING MORTY AN "A" IN MATH,

AND THAT'S MY IDEA.

THAT IS AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT.

WHAT THE HELL?

OUT OF THE FRYING PAN DOT,
DOT, DOT, HUH, MORTY?

OH, MAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR DOG BECAME SELF-AWARE

AND MADE MODIFICATIONS ON
THE COGNITION AMPLIFIER,

THEN TURNED ON JERRY, BETH,
AND SUMMER AFTER LEARNING

ABOUT HUMANITY'S CRUEL
SUBJUGATION OF HIS SPECIES,

BUT YOUR GUESS IS AS
GOOD AS MINE, MORTY.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW

BECAUSE HE'S SMART.

THIS IS WHY I CHOOSE TO GET C'S.
PSST, BETH, JERRY, SUMMER.

DAD!

RICK!

OH, THANK GOD, MORTY.

OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

IF WE HURRY WE CAN SET
UP CAMP IN A SEWER TUNNEL

OR SOMETHING BEFORE THE DOGS
COMPLETELY TAKE OVER.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

THIS IS MY HOUSE.

I'M NOT ABANDONING IT.

IT'S ALL OVER, JERRY.

THE DOGS ARE ON A PATH
TO TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION.

BUT, HEY, AT LEAST THEY KNOW NOT
TO PISS ON YOUR CARPET, RIGHT?

WAIT A MINUTE.

I HAVE AN IDEA.

GENTLEMEN,
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.

SEE THAT?

I'M PEEING ALL OVER
YOUR SPECIAL GUNS.

THAT MEANS I OWN THEM.

BAD PERSON. BAD.

OOH, GREAT PLAN, JERRY.

BRING THE BOY TO ME.

YOU WERE ALWAYS KIND TO ME,
MORTY.

THAT'S WHY I WILL LEAVE
YOU WITH YOUR TESTICLES.

FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE MY BEST
FRIEND AND LIVE BY MY SIDE.

TH-THANKS, SNUFFLES.

BEGIN PHASE TWO.

FIGHTING CONTINUES AS THE DOG

ARMY CAPTURES THE
EASTERN SEABOARD.

IT APPEARS CLEAR AT THIS TIME
THAT THE ERA OF HUMAN

SUPERIORITY HAS COME
TO A BITTER END.

PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

WHAT'S SHE SAYING, BILL?

I THINK SHE'S SAYING,
"I LOVE LASAGNA."

MMM.

THANK YOU, FIDO.

RICK!

I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!

NO, NO, NO,
I WAS JUST PLAYING DEAD.

GOOD NEWS, THOUGH, MORTY.

THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONNA BE OVER REALLY SOON.

WHAT?

IT'S A DREAM, MORTY.

WE'RE IN YOUR DOG'S DREAM.

THE NIGHT THE
DOGS CAPTURED US,

AFTER YOU CRIED AND
CRAPPED YOUR PANTS, WE...

WE ALL WENT TO SLEEP.

THEN I USED MY DREAM INCEPTORS
TO PUT THE TWO OF US INSIDE

SNUFFLES' DREAM.

BUT I-IT'S BEEN
LIKE A WHOLE YEAR!

IT'S BEEN SIX HOURS.

DREAMS MOVE ONE ONE-HUNDREDTH
THE SPEED OF REALITY,

AND DOG TIME IS
ONE-SEVENTH HUMAN TIME.

SO, YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY
HERE IS LIKE A MINUTE.

IT'S LIKE "INCEPTION," MORTY, SO
IF IT'S CONFUSING AND STUPID,

THEN SO IS EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE MOVIE.

AW, MAN.

I REALLY LIKED THIS LIFE.

WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T
REALLY CRAP MY PANTS.

NO, NO, THAT HAPPENED BEFORE
YOU WENT TO SLEEP, MORTY.

YOU'RE SLEEPING IN
YOUR CRAP RIGHT NOW.

OUT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT
HAPPENED TO YOU,

THAT WAS THE ONLY REAL
THING THAT, YOU KNOW,

IS THAT YOU CRAPPED YOUR PANTS.

I MEAN,
IT'S A MESS OUT THERE.

I GOT SOME ON MY HANDS, MORTY,
AND THEN I GOT IT ON THE DREAM

INCEPTOR, AND A PIECE
FELL IN MY MOUTH.

AW, MAN, GEEZ!

SERIOUSLY?

LOOK, D-D-D-DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT, MORTY.

HERE, HERE TAKE THESE, MORTY.

TAKE THESE.

ARE THESE PILLS SUPPOSED
TO WAKE ME UP, OR SOMETHING?

CLOSE.

IT'S GONNA MAKE YOUR
KIDNEYS SHUT DOWN.

WHAT?!

IT'S NECESSARY FOR THE PLAN,
MORTY.

DON'T EVEN TRIP, DAWG.

IT'S PRETTY BAD,
EMPEROR SNOWBALL.

WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO ANOTHER
OPERATION.

ANYTHING.

ANYTHING FOR MY PRECIOUS MORTY.

SIR, AS YOUR ACCOUNTANT,
I MUST ADVISE YOU THAT THESE

MEDICAL EXPENSES ARE PUTTING YOU
IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL JEOPARDY.

YOU COULD LOSE YOUR KINGDOM.

TO HELL WITH MY KINGDOM,
BEAN COUNTER.

I WOULD TRADE IT ALL FOR MY
HUMAN'S HEALTH AND HAPPINESS.

DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD
HAVE DONE THIS FOR US?

WE ARE NOT THEM!

WE ARE NOT...THEM.

ASSEMBLE THE TROOPS.

I'VE MADE A DECISION.

TAKING OVER THE HUMAN'S WORLD
WILL LEAD TO NOTHING BUT MORE HEARTBREAK,

MORE CRUELTY.

INSTEAD, WE WILL GO TO A NEW
WORLD AND COLONIZE IT WITH A

SOCIETY OF INTELLIGENT DOGS...

ONE THAT WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKES AS HUMANITY AND ONE

WHERE PET INSURANCE
WILL BE MANDATORY.

I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
SNOWBALL.

YOU CAN CALL ME SNUFFLES, MORTY,
AND I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, TOO,

VERY MUCH.

JERRY?

I'M SORRY.

IT'S JUST LIKE THE END OF
"OLD YELLER."

OH, JERRY.

YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT
HAD DOGS IN IT.

WOW!

A WHOLE WORLD POPULATED
BY INTELLIGENT DOGS.

I WONDER WHAT IT'LL
BE LIKE, RICK.

I THINK IT WILL
BE GREAT, MORTY.

YOU KNOW, IT'S G...I-I-I-I-IT
COULD BE DEVELOPED IN-INTO A

VERY SATISFYING PROJECT
FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES.

I MEAN, I'D WATCH IT, MORTY,
FOR AT LEAST 11 MINUTES A POP.

YOU KNOW, MAY-MAYBE THEY'LL
DO IT BOARD-DRIVEN.

YOU KNOW, THAT'S A REAL
COMFORTING IDEA, RICK.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW, MORTY?

WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

HI, GUYS.

I'M YOUR NEW TEACHER
FOR SCARY CLASS.

MY NAME IS SCARY MR. JOHNSON.

UH, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

THAT'S MY DAD'S NAME,
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

CALL ME SCARY GLENN, YEAH?

SO, ANYWAY, I UNDERSTAND YOUR
PREVIOUS TEACHER WAS HAVING YOU

WORK ON FUNDAMENTALS OF FEAR.

WHICH IS... WHAT IS THAT?

AND AWAY WE GO.

[ WARBLING ]

HUH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.
IT'S WORKING.

- OW, OW, OW!
- OH [BLEEP]

WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

I-I-I-I MEAN YOU FOUR!

BOTH: THAT HURT!
THAT WAS PAINFUL.

GOOD, I'M GLAD IT WAS PAINFUL.
YOU DESERVE IT.

I SAW YOU. Y-YOU'RE BOTH [BURPS]
ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE.

WE'VE BEEN SPLIT FOR 20 MINUTES
AND YOUR LIVES

ARE ALREADY SCATTERED
TO THE QUANTUM [BLEEP] WIND?

WHAT THE HELL DO EITHER
OF YOU TWO

HAVE TO BE SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT?
YOUR BRAND OF ZIT CREAM?

WHICH CHAIR TO SIT IN
WHILE I DO EVERYTHING?

COME ON, SPIT IT OUT! WELL, YOU
DON'T EXACTLY MAKE IT EASY, RICK.

YOU MAKE FUN OF ME ALL THE TIME...
YOU'RE ALWAYS PICKING ON ME...

AND NOW SUMMER'S DOING IT... AND
NOW YOU GOT SUMMER TO KISS YOUR ASS.

ME?! WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU'RE JUST AS
MEAN TO ME BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS...

COULD YOU GET MORE EXCITED TO SEE ME FAIL?
BECAUSE YOU WANT GRANDPA ALL TO YOURSELF!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, COOL IT.
I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

YOU'RE BOTH YOUNG,
YOU'RE BOTH UNSURE

ABOUT YOUR PLACE
IN THE UNIVERSE,

AND YOU BOTH WANT
TO BE GRANDPA'S FAVORITE.

I CAN FIX THIS.
MORTY, SIT HERE.

SUMMER, YOU SIT HERE.
NOW, LISTEN.

I KNOW THE TWO OF YOU
ARE VERY DIFFERENT

FROM EACH OTHER
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

THAT AS FAR
AS GRANDPA'S CONCERNED,

YOU'RE BOTH PIECES OF SHIT.
YEAH.

I CAN PROVE IT MATHEMATICALLY.

ACTUALLY, L-L-LET ME
GRAB MY WHITE BOARD.

THIS HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME COMING, ANYWAY.

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

EMERGENCY!
WOUNDED DEER COMING IN.

[ AIR HISSING ] - THREE.

EXCUSE ME,
YOU CAN'T BE BACK HERE.

I'M A CERTIFIED HORSE SURGEON,

AND THIS DEER
NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.

- NURSE, PLEASE MOVE THAT SNAKE.
- THAT'S MY NURSE.

AND AS A HORSE SURGEON,
I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW

THAT DEER HAVE MUCH SMALLER,
MUCH MORE INTRICATE ORGANS.

AS A VET, I'M SURE YOU KNOW
THAT A DEER

IS CLOSER TO A HORSE
THAN YOU ARE TO A DOCTOR.

SO LET'S SAVE THE MEASURING
FOR WHEN OUR DICKS ARE OUT.

- IT'S TIME TO SAVE A LIFE!
- GEEZ.

[ GRUNTS, SIGHS ]

THAT'S ODD.
THIS DEER'S WOUNDED.

UH, YEAH, I WAS THERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN.

I MEAN IT'S BEEN SHOT
WITH A GUN.

MAN: MY GUN.

MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

NO, BUT YOU CAN STOP
HELPING THIS DEER.

I SHOT IT BEFORE THESE TWO
HIT IT WITH THEIR CAR,

AND I FOLLOWED THEM
WHEN THEY HAULED IT OFF.

THIS DEER BELONGS TO ME.

[ SIGHS ] WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS, OKAY?

I NEED ANAESTHETIC
AND DEER SALINE.

LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE LAW SAYS ABOUT THIS,

BUT I TOOK AN OATH THAT I WOULD
LET NO ANIMAL COME TO HARM.

EXCEPT WHEN STERILIZING,
ABORTING, OR EUTHANIZING THEM,

OR ALSO WHEN EATING THEM
AT ALSO ANY MEAL.

I'M CALLING MY LAWYER.

I HOPE FOR ALL OUR SAKES YOU'RE AS
BAD A SURGEON AS I AM A HUNTER.

IN YOUR DREAMS, BITCH. SCALPEL.

SO, IN CONCLUSION,
YOU'RE BOTH EQUALLY MERCURIAL,

OVERLY SENSITIVE, CLINGY,

HYSTERICAL,
BIRD-BRAINED HOMUNCULI.

AND I HONESTLY CAN'T EVEN TELL THE
TWO OF YOU APART HALF THE TIME

BECAUSE I DON'T GO
BY HEIGHT OR AGE,

I GO BY AMOUNT
OF PAIN IN MY ASS,

WHICH MAKES YOU BOTH IDENTICAL.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING RESOLVED?

EVERYBODY NICE AND CERTAIN ABOUT
THEIR POSITION IN MY WORLD.

YES. YES. YES. YES.

ALL RIGHT, PERFECT. SIT STILL.

[ BURPS ] ARMS DOWN.
I'M GONNA DO THIS AGAIN.

THIS TIME BE LIKE GRANDPA.

YOU MEAN DRUNK?

WHAT'S THAT?
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY?

- NO.
- AND AWAY WE GO!

AND AWAY WE GO!

- HUH, THAT'S WEIRD.
- HUH, THAT'S WEIRD.

[ BUTTON CLICKING ]

- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

THE SON OF A BITCH IS GONNA KILL ME!
WHAT?!

THE SON OF A BITCH IS GONNA KILL ME!
WHAT?!

DIABOLICAL, UNFEELING SOCIOPATH.

- DON'T YOU GET IT?!
- DON'T YOU GET IT?!

THE OTHER RICK ISN'T TRYING
TO MERGE US ANYMORE.

HE THINKS
HE CAN SAVE HIS OWN SKIN

BY USING THE CRYSTAL TO KILL ME.

HE PROBABLY FIGURES
IT'S [BELCHES] EASIER

TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES
RATHER THAN MERGE THEM.

[ LAUGHS ] I HAVE TO ADMIT,

IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND, TOO.

THE DIFFERENCE IS
I WOULD NEVER DO IT, UNTIL NOW.

RICK, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
SAVING OUR LIVES!

AFTER HE TAKES ME OUT, HE'S...
HE'S GONNA BE COMING FOR YOU.

- WHO?
- ME!

[ GUNSHOT ] - AAH!

- WHOA!
- YOU SEE THAT? GET DOWN!

I TOLD YOU, HE'S A PSYCHO.
HE'S LOST IT!

TH-TH-TH-THE TIME FRACTURE
MUST HAVE MADE HIM CRAZY!

- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!
- OH, CRAP!

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!
[ RUMBLING ]

[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

OH, GOD,
NOW THERE'S THREE OF THEM.

WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.
GET IN THE CUPBOARDS.

WAIT, DON'T... DON'T DO THAT.

THEY'LL KNOW. WAIT, WAIT.

THINK ABOUT GETTING IN
THE CUPBOARDS, BUT DON'T REALLY.

[ GUNSHOTS ] [ SCREAMS ]

IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT,
YOU SICK [BLEEP]?!

YOU WANT TO SEE CHILDREN DIE?!

YOU SON OF A BITCH.

YOU DON'T STOP LMNG
UNTIL I SAY SO!

MICHAEL.

- WHO'S THIS NOW?
- MY LAWYER.

I'M HERE TO NOTIFY YOU, MA'AM,
THAT IN THIS COUNTY,

ANY DEER SHOT BY A HUNTER

IS THAT HUNTER'S PROPERTY
REGARDLESS OF HOW FAR IT RUNS

OR WHO INTERCEPTS IT
BEFORE IT DIES.

IT'S CALLED BRAD'S LAW.

WE CAN'T MAKE YOU
STOP THE SURGERY,

BUT AT THIS POINT,
YOU'RE PERFORMING IT ON VENISON.

ACTUALLY,
I'VE DECIDED NOT TO EAT IT.

ALL THIS FEAR AND CONFLICT...
I'M SURE IT'S RUINED THE MEAT.

I'M JUST GONNA USE THE HEAD
FOR MY REC-ROOM WALL.

SHE NORMALLY WORKS ON HORSES.

JERRY, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP,
GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

I WILL REACH INTO HEAVEN

AND YANK YOUR SCREAMING
DEER SOUL BACK!

JESUS.

SHH, SHH!

I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,
YOU CREEPY OLD MONSTER.

I KNOW HOW YOU THINK.

OH, IS THERE WHERE
YOU THINK I'M GOING?

YOU THINK I'M STANDING HERE?

WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

[ MORTY GRUNTS ]
[ RICK GROANS ]

SUMMER: HOLY [BLEEP] NOW WHAT?

WELL, IF ALL OF ME
KNOCKED OUT ALL THE RICKS,

AND YOU PEED
IN ALL OF YOUR PANTS,

DOESN'T THAT MEAN
THAT WE'RE ALL SYNCHRONIZED?

- RIGHT.
- OKAY.

SO, FROM NOW ON, WHATEVER WE DO,
WE HAVE TO BE CERTAIN.

RIGHT.

I THINK I'M CERTAIN
WE'RE EFFED IN THE "A."

[ CATS MEOWING, PURRING ]

OH, GOD, MY HEAD.

[ GROANS ]
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO?

WE PUT YOU IN A DOG CRATE
BECAUSE YOU WERE ACTING CRAZY

AND YOU CAUSED
ANOTHER TIME FRACTURE.

YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF.

O-ONLY IN SELF-DEFENSE.

MYSELF TRIED TO KILL ME FIRST.

GUYS, I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THIS,

BUT TIME BREAKING TWICE
MEANS OUR PROBLEM IS

TWO TIMES BIGGER AND WE'VE GOT
HALF AS MUCH TIME TO SOLVE IT.

WELL, ACTUALLY, I DO EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

IT'S BASIC MATH. C-CAN SOMEBODY
JUST LET ME OUT OF HERE?

IF I DIE IN A CAGE,
I LOSE A BET.

WELL, IS THERE SOME WAY
YOU CAN PROVE

YOU'RE NOT A THREAT TO YOURSELF
AND OTHERS ANYMORE?

OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
ALL RIGHT, HERE.

- GIVE ME THE TIME CRYSTAL.
- WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

CALLING MYSELF. HERE, LISTEN.

IT'LL [BURPS] PROBABLY GO
TO VOICEMAIL

SINCE, YOU KNOW,
I'M CALLING MYSELF.

HELLO, RICK HERE.

DON'T FALL FOR IT. IT'S A BIT.

JUST KIDDING! HA, HA!

YOU JUST GOT RICKED.

YOU'VE REACHED
RICK'S VOICEMAIL.

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. [  BEE ]

HEY, RICK. IT'S RICK.

LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
NO HARD FEELINGS.

I KNOW YOU KNOW I MEAN IT, TOO.
TAKE IT EASY.

WHOA, DAMN! LOOK AT THIS.

I'M BLOWING UP...
THREE NEW VOICEMAILS.

HEY, RICK. IT'S RICK.

LISTEN,
I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I HEARD THIS ONE.

HEY, RICK. IT'S RICK.

HEY, RICK, IT'S...
YOU GET THE IDEA.

[ BURPS ] W-WE'RE COOL NOW.

OKAY, WELL, WE'RE STILL NOT
GONNA LET YOU OUT OF THIS CRATE.

FINE. I'LL JUST DO IT MYSELF.

IF YOU COULD GET OUT THAT WHOLE
TIME, WHY DIDN'T YOU?

BECAUSE I WAITED
UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN

IT WAS WHAT I WANTED
TO DO, MORTY.

THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

I'M CERTAIN, AND YOU'RE

A WALKING BURLAP SACK FILLED
WITH TURDS.

YOU KNOW, GEEZ, RICK!

Y-Y-YOU'RE REALLY TEARING
INTO ME RIGHT NOW.

YOU KNOW, WORDS HURT.

- HOLY!
- A MONSTER!

HEY, YOU... HEY, QUIT YELLING.

QUIT YELLING. WHAT THE [BLEEP]

YOUR TIME IS ALL RIPPED UP
TO HELL!

[ WARBLES ]
YOU BROKE YOUR TIME TWICE.

- [ SIGHS ]
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

[ ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]

NEVERMIND. SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP.
OH, DAMN.

I'M FROM THE FOURTH DIMENSION.

I CAN HEAR ALL OF Y'ALL.

NOW LET'S JUST SEE WHAT WE GOT
HERE FOR A SECOND.

- [ GROANS ]
- HEY, DAMN IT.

WERE YOU TRYING
TO USE THIS TO...

OH, SEE, YOU BROKE TIME,
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD

JUST STICK IT BACK TOGETHER
WITH THIS?

HOW YOU THINK
YOU GONNA MOVE TIME

WHILE YOU'RE STANDING IN IT,

YOU DUMBASS THREE-DIMENSIONAL
MONKEY-ASS DUMMIES?

OH, WAY TO GO, RICK.

YEAH, GRANDPA, WAY TO GO.

WHAT, YOU'RE JUST GONNA LISTEN
TO THIS GUY NOW?

HE'S GOT A GIANT TESTICLE
FOR A HEAD.

HE CAME HERE IN A BUBBLE.

FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE COULD BE

THE DAVID BERKOWITZ
OF NUTSACKLAND.

SHUT UP. HERE, PUT THESE ON.

THEY'LL SYNC
YOUR POSSIBILITIES UP

SO I CAN BRING YOU BACK
TO CERTAIN TIME.

Y'ALL ARE JUST...
JUST... JUST NEGLIGENT.

SEE, NOW...
NOW LOOK RIGHT HERE.

HEY, HEY, HEY, THE THREE OF YOU,
PUT YOUR COLLARS ON.

- WE HAVE THEM ON.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

- UH, WE DID.
- WE'RE NOT WEARING COLLARS.

EXACTLY.
'CAUSE YOU'RE BEING OBSTINATE.

[ BELCHES ] WHAT?

PUT THE DAMN COLLARS ON
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.

- THEY'RE ON RIGHT NOW.
- WE DID. THEY'RE ON.

ALL RIGHT, FINE.
SUMMER, MORTY, PUT THEM ON.

[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

[ WARBLING ]

- YES, WE'RE BACK!
- NO MORE CATS!

- WE'RE BACK IN CERTAIN TIME.
- PROBLEM SOLVED.

NO MORE CATS! OH, YOU DID IT!

- YOU FIXED IT.
- YEAH, I DID.

NOW KEEP THOSE
COLLARS ON SO YOU

DON'T BREAK
YOUR WEAK-ASS TIME AGAIN.

HOW LONG, EXACTLY, DO WE HAVE
TO WEAR THESE THINGS?

THEY'RE REALLY EMBARRASSING.

WELL, SINCE YOU'RE GOING
TO TIME PRISON,

I'D SAY YOU CAN
KEEP THEM ON FOREVER.

- TIME PRISON?
- YEAH.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
EXPECT ME TO THINK

YOU GOT
THAT CRYSTAL OVER THERE,

BUT THE ONLY WAY YOUR DUMBASS
ASSIN' ASS ASSES

COULD EVER HAVE ON
IS IF IT WAS STOLEN.

YOU STOLE A TIME-FREEZING
CRYSTAL FROM TESTICLE MONSTERS?!

I WOULD'VE BEEN HAPPY TO PAY
FOR IT, S... [BURPS] SUMMER,

BUT THEY DON'T EXACTLY SELL THEM
AT COSTCO.

BESIDES, THERE'S A LARGER LESSON
TO BE LEARNED HERE. GET HIM!

NO, NO, NO, NO!
YOU BETTER KEEP BACK!

MAN, THIS WILL TURN YOUR ASS

INTO A THIRD-TRIMESTER FETUS
FROM 30 YARDS.

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

MM.

ISN'T THERE A KITTEN SOMEWHERE
THAT NEEDS A MANICURE?

THAT'S RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.
GIVE IN TO YOUR ANGER.

NEGLECT THAT DEER.

HONEY, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

THESE MEN ARE
FROM THE CERVINE INSTITUTE

OF OF ELK, MOOSE, DEER,
AND STAG.

THEY CAN TAKE THIS DEER
TO A HELICOPTER

AND FLY IT TO THE COUNTRY'S
TOP DEER SURGEON

ON A WILDLIFE RESERVE
ACROSS THE STATE BORDER.

WHERE YOUR JURISDICTION ENDS.

I GUESS THAT'S THE END OF THAT.

THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING.

ACCORDING TO THIS STATE'S
VETERINARIAN STATUTE,

THIS ANIMAL
CAN'T BE TRANSFERRED

UNTIL THE CURRENT
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN

VERBALLY CONFIRMS
THEIR INABILITY

TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE CARE.

YOU HEARD THE MAN,

YOU HAVE TO SAY
YOU COULDN'T HACK IT.

WE DID IT!

UH-HUH. NO, MOTHER... NO.
EARTH, DUDE.

NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT...
YEAH, WITH THE DINOSAURS.

NO, IF YOU GET TO THE DOLPHIN
PEOPLE, YOU GONE TOO FAR.

ALL RIGHT, MAN,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. OKAY.

YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO

TO THIRD-DIMENSIONAL LIFE FORMS
IN TIME PRISON?

SAME THING THEY DO IN EVERY
OTHER PRISON, ONLY FOREVER.

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

YOU THINK I WANT TO BE
AN OMNISCIENT IMMORTAL BEING

TRANSCENDING TIME AND SPACE
MY WHOLE LIFE?

I GOT AMBITIONS, MAN.

BRINGING YOU GUYS IN
IS MY TICKET UP.

WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THERE'S A HUGE TICKET

UP RIGHT BEHIND YOU?

YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT STUPID?

ALL RIGHT, HEAR ME OUT ON THIS.

YOU'RE IMMORTAL, RIGHT, WHICH
MEANS YOUR LIFE IS INFINITE.

OKAY, WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
THERE'S A 100% CHANCE

THAT YOU'LL
EVENTUALLY DO EVERYTHING,

INCLUDING TURNING AROUND
TO LOOK BEHIND YOU.

I CANNOT ARGUE THAT.

[ THUD! ] - AAAH!

[ SQUEALS ]
OH, GOD, GROSS AND WEIRD!

CHRIS! [ SPLAT! ]

YOU KILLED MY GUN!

TAKE OFF YOUR COLLARS.

WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

GOOD QUESTION. I SUPPOSE
THE ANSWER IS I'M NOT CERTAIN.

OH, NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- I'M NOT SURE.

STOP IT!

[ ECHOING ] MAYBE I WILL,
MAYBE I WON'T.

I'M REALLY UNCERTAIN
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

EVEN KICKING YOUR ASS.

LIST... HEY! TW... OW!

BUT THE... THESE ARMS
ARE VESTIGIAL! [ GRUNTS ]

NOW, YOU POKED ME WHERE
AN EYE WOULD'VE BEEN

ABOUT 6 MILLION YEARS AGO.

LET'S HELP GRANDPA.

NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING!

YEAH, TOTALLY UNCERTAIN.

BEAT HIS ASS!
GET HIM! BEAT HIM UP!

- KICK HIS ASS, RICK!
- DIE, MOTHER[BLEEP]

OW! I'M DEFEATED.

- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- TIME IS FALLING APART.

WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO CERTAINTY QUICK.

GIVE ME YOUR COLLARS.

OH, MAN. DON'T YOU HAVE TO FIX,
LIKE, 30 OF THEM?

MORTY, I HAVE TO FIX THREE
OF THEM.

AND THEN THERE'S 31
OTHER VERSIONS OF ME

THAT HAVE TO ALSO FIX THREE,
FOR A TOTAL OF 96.

I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
I KNOW HOW TO BE DECISIVE.

NOW HAND ME THAT FLAT-HEAD SCREWDRIVER.
NOW HAND ME THAT PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER.

- ACTUALLY, MAKE IT A FLAT-HEAD.
- ACTUALLY, MAKE IT A PHILLIPS.

OH, SHIT.

LOOK, I KNOW I WAS
KIND OF A NUISANCE TODAY.

I KNOW IT'S MY FAULT
WE HIT THE DEER.

AND I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO BE THE ONE TO SAVE IT.

WHATEVER.

HOW PETTY WOULD I HAVE TO BE
TO CARE LESS

ABOUT AN ANIMAL'S LIFE
THAN MY OWN EGO?

WELL, YOU'D HAVE
TO BE PRETTY PETTY.

BUT YOU'D STILL BE
THE WOMAN I MARRIED.

[ CAR RATTLES ]
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

ONE LAST STOP.

[ TIRES SQUEAL ]

WHERE'S THE HELICOPTER?

THERE IS NO HELICOPTER.

AND THERE IS
NO CERVINE INSTITUTE.

BUT THE TOP DEER SURGEON...

I'M LOOKING AT HER.

UP LIKE THAT.

FOR BASIC ICE-CREAM WORK.

- GREAT.
- RICK!

THE COLLAR.
OH, THE LATCH IS BROKEN.

IT WON'T LATCH CLOSED
AROUND MY NECK.

- OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- GEEZ, WHAT'S GOING ON?

HOW COME OUR COLLARS
AREN'T GREEN?

OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE SOMEONE
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT

HIS COLLAR ON, AND ONE OF ME
IS STUCK TRYING TO HELP HIM.

DON'T BLAME THIS ON ME. YOU'RE THE
ONE THAT COULDN'T FIX A LATCH.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S NOT BROKEN, MORTY.

I FIXED IT. JUST PUT IT ON.

IT WON'T CLOSE. IT'S BROKEN.

FINE, BRING IT HERE.

- RICK!
- MORTY!

- IT'S A CLASSIC DANCE.

"KING OF THE WORLD" BIT?

WELL, IT'S NOT
THE "KING OF THE WORLD" BIT.

THAT'S JACK AND FABRIZIO.

THIS IS WHERE ROSE SAYS,
"I'M FLYING, JACK!"

BUT WHATEVER.

I CAN BE THE ONLY ONE
TO DO IT ALONE.

WELL, WHAT ABOUT HER?
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
MY PLACE IN LINE?

I, UH... I COULD GET
INTO TROUBLE.

WE WON'T TELL.

SO...
YOU'RE A TITANIC FANATIC?

OH, YES. I'VE WORKED HERE
SINCE IT OPENED,

BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO PARTICIPATE.

HAPPY TO HELP... ROSE.

I LOVE WATCHING BUKKAKE.

I MEAN, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF I
PERSONALLY WOULD EVER DO IT...

- BRAD! HEY!
- YO.

BRAD IS HERE! QUICK, MAKE
MY HAIR LOOK DRUNK.

CHECK IT OUT.
TAMMY'S ALREADY DRUNK.

COOL.

THE BEACON WAS ACTIVATED.

WHO IS IN DANGER?
- UGH! GRANDPA!

BIRDPERSON!

I AM PLEASED THERE IS
NO EMERGENCY.

OH, THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,
ALL RIGHT.

A PUSSY EMERGENCY!

WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT LAID, 'PERS?

IT HAS BEEN A... CHALLENGING
MATING SEASON FOR BIRDPERSON.

THEN IT'S TIME TO GET
YOUR BEAK WET TONIGHT, PLAYER.

GO HAVE SOME FUN OUT THERE
BIRDP... BIRD... BIRDPERSON.

OH, MAN, HOW MANY
PEOPLE DID YOU INVITE, RICK?

UH... PEOPLE?
MM, SIX.

YO! WHAT UP,
MY GLIP GLOPS?!

OH, MAN!

OH!

Y-Y-YOU KNOW THERE'S
A GARBAGE, RIGHT?

HEY, UH, WHAT THE HELL?!

OOH. THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER
INVITE A FLOOPY DOOP

AND A SHMOOPY DOOP
TO THE SAME PARTY.

OH, OH, G...
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING!

YOU GUYS ARE
IN MY PARENTS' BED!

OH. SORRY.
I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.

I JUST NEEDED TO LIE DOWN
FOR A BIT.

OH. OKAY. S-S-SORRY.

OH, MY GOD!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

THE THING PEOPLE DON'T
REALIZE ABOUT THE GEAR WARS

IS THAT IT WAS NEVER REALLY
ABOUT THE GEARS AT ALL.

UH-HUH. YEAH.
NO, NO, TO-TOTALLY.

RICK, YOU GOTTA STOP...

MORTY!
HAVE YOU MET GEARHEAD?

- HEY, HOW'S...
- MORTY HERE, HE...

HE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT THE GEAR WARS.

HOW FAMILIAR ARE YOU
WITH THE GEAR WARS, EXACTLY?

UH... NOT AT ALL.

OH, BOY.
I ENVY YOU.

OKAY, IT WAS ABOUT
754 YEARS AGO...

OH, HEY, MORTY! H-HAVE YOU MET
MY BUDDY SCROPON?

NOT AGAIN, RICK.

THAT LAST GUY DRONED ON FOR
20 MINUTES, YOU KNOW?

AND MEANWHILE, THE WHOLE HOUSE
IS BEING DESTROYED!

WHOA, MORTY, THIS GUY'S
ENTIRE PLANET WAS DESTROYED.

HAVE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

HEY, RICK, SQUANCHY PARTY,
BRO!

AW! SQUANCHY!

IS THERE A GOOD PLACE FOR ME
TO SQUANCH AROUND HERE?

SQUANCHY, YOU CAN
SQUANCH WHEREVER YOU WANT, MAN.

MI CASA ES SU CASA, DAWG!

ALL RIGHT!
I LIKE YOUR SQUANCH!

UH, RICK, WHAT EXACTLY
IS "SQUANCHING"?

MORTY, LISTEN...
WE'VE HAD A LOT

OF REALLY COOL ADVENTURES
OVER THE LAST YEAR,

BUT IT'S TIME TO RELAX.

YEAH, IF I RELAX NOW,
THERE MIGHT NOT

EVEN BE ANY
MORE ADVENTURES!

JESUS, MORTY, YOU'RE
BUMMING ME OUT.

CAN'T WE JUST PRETEND LIKE
EVERYTHING'S FINE

FOR A FEW HOURS,
ENJOY OURSELVES,

AND THEN WORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS LATER?

YEAH, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY, RICK.

YOU KNOW, YOU LIKE NOT
CARING ABOUT STUFF.

YOU KNOW, WH-WH-WHAT'S
IN THIS FOR ME?

JESSICA.

KNOCK IT OFF,
SLOW MOBIUS!

HA HA! SORRY, DUDE!

I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW OFF
MY POWERS, BRO!

I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S HERE.

WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING STANDING HERE, MORTY?

GO. TALK TO HER.

TONIGHT, THE ONLY ADVENTURE
YOU'RE ON

IS YOUR CUSPING
MANHOOD.

OH, ROSE.

WHEE!

IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

YES, EVERY COUPLE GETS
TO RE-CREATE JACK'S DROWNING

AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.

IT'S SO ROMANTIC.

I CAN'T WAIT TO DO
THAT WITH BETH.

I DON'T KNOW, JERRY.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT...

IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR WIFE
MAY NOT BE THAT INTERESTED.

LOOK!

ICEBERG, RIGHT AHEAD!
THE BUFFET IS NOW CLOSED.

UH, SIR?
THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM?

THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM
ISN'T PUTTING US

ON A DIRECT COLLISION
COURSE.

THIS SHIP IS ABOUT TO COMPLETELY
MISS THE GIANT ICEBERG!

WELL, DO SOMETHING!
STEER INTO IT!

I'M TRYING!

IT'S TOO LATE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

DON'T BRACE YOURSELVES.

NO! WHAT HAPPENED?!

THEIR RAIL SYSTEM MUST HAVE FAILED.

TOTALLY GONNA GET LAID
TONIGHT.

I LIKE YOUR FEATHERS.

THEY ARE DESIGNED TO ATTRACT
THE ATTENTION OF THE FEMALE.

IT'S WORKING.

TAMMY, I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

I JUST GOT OUT OF A HIGHLY
INTENSE SOUL BOND

WITH MY PREVIOUS SPIRIT MATE.

I'M NOT LOOKING TO GET
INTO A SOUL BOND.

I'M JUST LOOKING FOR...

I BELIEVE BIRDPERSON CAN
ARRANGE THAT.

HEY, SUMMER, HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AT FLUTE PRACTICE IN A WHILE.

SUMMER, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH HER.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE.

WHOA. NOT COOL, SUMMER.
THIS IS A PARTY.

EVERYBODY SHOULD BE WELCOME.

OH, GREAT. WHO INVITED
ABRADOLPH LINCOLER?

I THOUGHT EVERYONE
WAS WELCOME.

IT'S NOT THE SAME,
SUMMER.

LINCOLER IS A CRAZED MANIAC...

JUST A MISGUIDED EFFORT
OF MINE TO CREATE

A MORALLY NEUTRAL
SUPERLEADER BY COMBINING

THE DNA OF ADOLF HITLER
AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

TURNS OUT IT JUST ADDS
UP TO A LAME, WEIRD LOSER.

RICK, YOU BROUGHT ME
INTO THIS WORLD,

A SUFFERING ABOMINATION

TORTURED BY THE DUALITY
OF ITS BEING.

BUT I SHALL FINALLY
KNOW PEACE

WHEN I WATCH THE LIFE DRAIN
FROM YOUR WRETCHED BODY!

WHOA. WHAT'S UP, MAN?

I HAVE NO QUARREL
WITH YOU, BOY.

"BOY"?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

IT'S JUST... I-LOOK,

I-I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THOUGHT
I MEANT IT, BUT...

DON'T LOOK AT ME, DUDE.

LOOK, I'M
HALF-ABRAHAM LINCOLN, SO...

SO I SHOULD GET ON MY KNEES
AND KISS YOUR ASS?!

WELL, NO, BUT...

YOU KNOW?
- WHAT DO I KNOW?

THAT THE THIRD REICH WILL REIGN
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS?

- LEAVE HIM ALONE, BRAD.
- STAY OUT OF THIS, JESSICA!

KICK HIS ASS, BRAD!
KICK HIS ASS!

KICK HIS ASS! KICK HIS ASS!

BRAD!

STUPID!

RICK!

I JUST DID YOU A FAVOR,
MORTY.

SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.

RICK HAS SOME REALLY
STRANGE FRIENDS.

UGH! BRAD IS SUCH A JERK.

HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO PROVE
WHAT A MAN HE IS.

I JUST WANT TO FIND SOMEBODY
NICE AND SWEET.

JESSICA, CAN I SHOW
YOU SOMETHING?

- WOW! LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
- YEAH.

THIS IS ME AND MY GRANDPA RICK'S
SCI-FI WORKSHOP.

CHECK THIS OUT.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

YOU KNOW, JESSICA,
THERE'S SOMETHING

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO TELL YOU.

- WHAT'S THAT, MORTY?
- I THINK YOU'RE THE MOST...

NO, THAT...
THOSE WEIRD SOUNDS

COMING FROM THE CLOSET
OVER THERE.

- OH, MY GOD!
- AAH!

HEY, I'M SQUANCHING IN HERE!

OH, MY GOD!
OH, THAT IS SO DISGUSTING!

OW! OH! OH, CRAP!

HUH.
BIG STAR IN THE SKY.

OXYGEN-RICH ATMOSPHERE.

GIANT TESTICLE MONSTERS.

WE'LL BE FINE! LET'S PARTY!

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT ASS, BITCH,
AND LET ME SEE WHATCHA GOT ♪

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT ASS... ♪

I SWEAR TO GOD, MORTY,
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT

THAT EVERYONE'S STILL
HAVING A BLAST IN THERE,

I WOULD BE SO FURIOUS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

OH, MAN.
Y-YOU HEAR THAT, MORTY?

YOU REALLY LUCKED OUT
WITH SUMMER O-ON THAT ONE.

HOW ARE YOU GUYS NOT
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW?!

T-THE WHOLE HOUSE IS SITTING
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION!

I-I MEAN, W-WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?!

M-M-MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA
KILL US!

I'M LOSING IT HERE, RICK!
- RELAX, MORTY, RELAX!

IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GO OUT
AND FIND US

SOME KALAXIAN CRYSTALS.

OH, SHIT, MOTHERFUCKER!

KALAXIAN CRYSTALS, MORTY,

JUST A FEW MILES SOUTH
OF HERE.

OKAY. LET'S GO, THEN.

W-W-WE GOT TO GO GET THOSE
CRYSTALS RIGHT NOW, RICK.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MORTY, I-I CAN'T GO WITH YOU.

I GOT TO HANG BACK

AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING STAYS
COOL HERE, YOU KNOW?

I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WHAT... WHAT
IF SOMEBODY BREAKS SOMETHING?

YEAH. ME TOO.
I SHOULD STAY.

YOU GUYS HAVE ANY ASPIRIN?

OH, HEY, MORTY,
THIS IS PERFECT!

YOU CAN TAKE LINCOLER
WITH YOU.

HEY, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I'M INJURED.

SHUT UP, LINCOLER.

IT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
FOR WRECKING THE LIVING ROOM.

YEAH! AND, NANCY,
YOU SHOULD GO, TOO.

WHAT? WHY... WHY ME?

BECAUSE, UH, YOU'RE...

YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT PLAYING THE FLUTE.

SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, FOLKS.

WE SHOULD RESUME SINKING SHORTLY.

IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE,
STAY ON THE SHIP

AND ENJOY A COMPLIMENTARY PLATE
OF JAMES CAMERONION RINGS.

GREAT. NOT ONLY IS
THE SHIP NOT SINKING,

BUT NOW THE FOURTH WALL
HAS BEEN BROKEN.

I AM GONNA GO BACK
TO THE ROOM TO FINISH MY BOOK.

YOU SHOULD FIND THAT
LUCY WOMAN.

BUT... BUT...

YOU SEE, JERRY?

MAY I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

HAD EVERYTHING GONE
AS PLANNED,

THIS ENTIRE AREA
WOULD BE UNDERWATER.

I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE IT.

THIS TRIP HAS BEEN A "TITANIC"
FAILURE.

GET IT?
OOH!

- DRAW ME, JERRY.
- OH, BOY.

LUCY, WOW.

UH, THIS ISN'T
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

BUT IT'S THE PERFECT MOMENT.

WE'VE BEEN DREAMING
ABOUT THIS FOR 16 YEARS.

UM, NOT LIKE THIS.
NOT... NOT WITH YOU.

YOU ARE GONNA DRAW ME.

THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FUCK
ME IN THAT CAR OVER THERE.

IT'S WEIRD,
'CAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK

THAT ALL MEN
ARE CREATED EQUAL.

BUT, AT THE SAME TIME...
- OKAY!

UM, THE CRYSTALS SHOULD BE
REALLY CLOSE.

THERE THEY ARE!

WAIT.
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

GET THE CRYSTALS!
I'LL HANDLE THE BEAST!

PREPARE TO BE EMANCIPATED FROM
YOUR OWN INFERIOR GENES!

SUMMER'S GONNA LIKE ME AGAIN.

LINCOLER, COME ON!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

MEIN JOURNEY IS OVER, MORTY.

I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.

♪ AND THE GEARS, THEY TURNED
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS ♪

♪ UNTIL THE DARK DAY
THAT THEY STOPPED ♪

RICK, I GOT THEM!

I GOT THE CRYSTALS!

ALL RIGHT!
YOU DID IT, MORTY.

RICK, WAIT! THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT LINCOLER.

HE SAID THAT HE WAS
REALLY SORRY

AND THAT HE LOVES YOU
LIKE A FATHER.

HE ONLY WANTED YOU
TO ACCEPT HIM,

AND HE HOPES THAT
HIS FINAL ACT

WOULD REDEEM HIM
IN YOUR EYES.

HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO SAVE
ALL OF US, RICK.

HE DIED.

WELL, AT LEAST
HE DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

HE GOT THESE CRYSTALS.

AND THESE BABIES JUST SAVED
THIS LAME-ASS PARTY!

WUBBA, LUBBA, DUB, DUB!

PLAY SOMETHING.
S-SOMEBODY, PLAY SOMETHING.

WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT?

♪ PUT YOUR RIGHT FOOT FORWARD
AND YOUR LEFT FOOT BACK ♪

♪ THEN SLIDE AROUND LIKE

WHOA, MAN!

WHAT THE HELL WAS
THAT?!

I THOUGHT THOSE CRYSTALS WERE
SUPPOSED TO HELP US

GET HOME OR SOMETHING!

WHAT? NO, NO, NO, I CAN GET US HOME
WHENEVER I WANT TO.

BUT, LISTEN, SPEAKING OF THOSE
CRYSTALS, CAN I GET THE REST OF THEM?

I'M STARTING TO COME DOWN,
MORTY.

CRYSTAL KALAXIAN IS A REALLY
STRONG, BUT FLEETING HIGH.

THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF YOUR
CRYSTALS, RICK!

OH, MORTY, YOU IDIOT!

DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE
ANY MORE K-LAX?

B-BIRDPERSON?
UH, SQUANCHY?

DON'T SQUAUNCH AT ME.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
PARTY IS OFFICIALLY OVER!

RICK, TAKE US HOME NOW.

ALL RIGHT, FINE, MORTY,
YOU PARTY POOPER BUZZKILL!

BOO, BOO! MORTY SUCKS!

BOO! YOU SUCK,
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS.

MORTY, YOU'RE THE WORST, MORTY.

BUT THESE GEARS JUST
STARTED TURNIN'.

ALMOST FINISHED, JERRY?

UH, ALMOST.

I HAVEN'T QUITE CAPTURED
YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES.

I'M SURE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
MOVE!

EVERY WEEKEND,
JACKS AND ROSES HAVE

THEIR TITANIC EXPERIENCE
IN THIS CAR,

AND I HAVE TO MOP IT UP.

THE FLOOR DROPS OUT
TO MAKE IT EASIER.

BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN.

WE'RE GOING TO GET IT NICE
AND STEAMY IN THERE,

AND I'M GOING TO SLAM MY HAND
ON THE STEAM

AND LEAVE A NICE HANDPRINT,

AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
INSIDE OF ME.

NO MESS. NO CLEAN.

BETH!

BET YOU'RE GLAD I THINK
KINDLES ARE DUMB NOW.

I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY.

I DIDN'T PEG LUCY
FOR A RAPIST.

WHAT DOES A RAPIST
LOOK LIKE EXACTLY, BETH?

IS IT A SLAVIC MAN
WEARING A DENIM JACKET

WITH A PATCHY BEARD
AND THE SCENT OF CHEAP CHAMPAGNE

WAFTING OVER HIS
BLISTER-POCKED LIPS?

WHAT?

WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT
ALL THIS FREE STUFF.

SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOUR
TITANIC JONES FOR A WHILE.

I'M NOT GOING TO FIT.

BETH, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUTTA HERE.

YOU'RE GONNA GO ON, AND...

JERRY, JUST LEAVE
THE DOOR.

IT'S NOT A DOOR, BETH.
IT'S DEBRIS.

I DON'T CARE.
JUST LEAVE IT.

YEAH. OKAY.

"CAPE FEAR"!

I'M... I'M DOING... I'M...
I'M GOING TO DO LIKE

FROM "CAPE FEAR."

HEY, SQUANCHERS!

THE PARTY'S SQUANCHING ON
AT MY PLACE!

- COOL.
- I'M COMING, TOO.

UH, NO.
YOU'RE NOT SQUANCHY ENOUGH...

FOR A SQUANCHY PARTY.
- WHAT?

NANCY TOLD US
WHAT A BITCH YOU ARE.

GUYS, SERIOUSLY.
NANCY?

SUMMER, YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.

ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS HAVING
POPULAR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

THAT'S NOT WHAT
ABRADOLPH LINCOLER STOOD FOR.

WELL, I-IT WAS HARD TO PIN DOWN
WHAT HE STOOD FOR,

BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
WHAT HE DIED FOR.

NEXT TIME I PARTY,
I'M JUST GONNA FOCUS

ON GETTING
TOTALLY WRECKED.

YOU'RE SO WISE.

MAY I ASSIST YOU WITH THAT?

UH, SURE, YEAH.
THANKS.

MORTY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
"WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB" MEANS?

UH, THAT'S JUST RICK'S
STUPID NONSENSE CATCHPHRASE.

IT'S NOT NONSENSE AT ALL.

IN MY PEOPLE'S TONGUE,
IT MEANS,

"I AM IN GREAT PAIN.
PLEASE HELP ME."

WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
HE'S SAYING IT IRONICALLY.

NO, MORTY.
YOUR GRANDFATHER IS, INDEED,

IN VERY DEEP PAIN.

THAT IS WHY HE MUST NUMB
HIMSELF.

- COME ON, UM...
- BIRDPERSON.

COME ON, BIRDPERSON.
RICK'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

HE'S JUST A HUGE ASSHOLE.

THEN WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH
IF YOU ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED

TO CONTINUE ON YOUR ADVENTURES
TOGETHER?

IT APPEARS FATE HAS PRESENTED
YOU WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

TO FREE YOURSELF OF RICK
FOREVER.

YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T EVEN CARE.

THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME.

I'M SICK OF HAVING ADVENTURES
WITH RICK.

MY PEOPLE HAVE ANOTHER
SAYING...

"GUBBA NUB NUB DOO RAH
KAH."

IT MEANS, "WHATEVER LETS YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT."

GUYS, MOM AND DAD ARE, LIKE,

RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

THIS IS YOUR MOMENT, MORTY.
CHOOSE WISELY.

TAMMY!

CAW!

WOW. WE ARE SO SCREWED.

- RICK, WAKE UP.
- HUH? WHAT? WAIT? WHAT? STOP.

RICK, YOU GOT TO DO
SOMETHING QUICK.

MY PARENTS ARE HOME.

UH, ALL... ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. HOLD... HOLD ON.

AHH! SO GOOD.

OH, MY GOD. THEY'RE WALKING UP
THE DRIVEWAY.

- BRING ME THE THING.
- WHAT... WHAT THING?

THE THING. THE THING.

IT'S GOT, LIKE, BUTTONS ON IT
AND LIGHTS ON IT.

IT... IT... IT BEEPS.
- RICK!

THAT DESCRIBES EVERYTHING
IN YOUR GARAGE!

DO YOU MEAN THIS?

SUMMER FOR
FOR THE WIN.

ALL RIGHT,
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

- WHOA! WHAT DID YOU DO?
- UH, S-SEE FOR YOURSELF.

WHOA!

YEAH, E-EVERYTHING'S
FROZEN IN TIME.

YEAH, AND SLOW MOBIUS THINKS
HE'S ALL THAT.

FOR HOW LONG?

I DON'T KNOW.
HOW LONG DO YOU GUYS WANT?

A WEEK? A MONTH?

CAN WE START CLEANING THE HOUSE
AND SEE HOW WE FEEL?

- WORST MOVIE EVER.
- DUMB.

OOH, BOY, WHAT A WASTE
OF TIME.

GET IT?
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE IT'S FROZEN.

THIS HAS BEEN
SO MUCH FUN.

HEY, RICK.
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE TIME,

I HAVEN'T ONCE
HEARD YOU SAY THAT

"WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB" THING
THAT YOU USUALLY SAY.

DON'T NEED TO.

I HAVE A NEW
CATCHPHRASE.

OH, YEAH?
WHAT... WHAT'S THAT, RICK?

- I LOVE MY GRANDKIDS.
- AWW.

PSYCH! JUST KIDDING...
MY NEW CATCHPHRASE IS,

"I DON'T GIVE
A FUCK!"

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT ASS, BITCH,
AND LET ME SEE WHATCHA GOT ♪

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT ASS, BITCH,
AND LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT ♪

ROLL CREDITS!

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT A... ♪
ROLL THE CREDITS! GO!

♪ JUST SHAKE THAT ASS ♪
THAT'S THE END OF SEASON ONE!

THAT'S THE END, MOTHERFUCKER!

"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK" IS
MY NEW CATCHPHRASE!

FUCK YOU!

THAT'S SEASON ONE! BOOM!

SEASON ONE UP IN YOUR FACE,
MOTHERFUCKER!

YEAH!

REVENGE.

WHAT?!

PARTY!

WHOO, BABY!

PLEASE, STOP!

HEY, BRAH!

I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ARE YOU ENJOYING THIS?

DO YOU LIKE THIS?

YEAH, YOU KNOW IT, DAWG!

I MEAN, REALLY GET IN THERE
AND KNOCK THEM AROUND.

NO WRONG ANSWERS.

WOW.

WELL, OKAY, JESSICA.

L-LET'S GIVE THIS A SHOT.

MM.

OH, MORTY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

UH, I-I'M JUST
DOING MY BEST.

MORTY!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?!

JESSICA.

MORTY!

JESSICA.

FIVE MORE MINUTES OF THIS,
AND I'M GONNA GET MAD.

JE-JESSICA.

JESSICA.

NOT MY FAULT
THIS IS HAPPENING.

WELL, WELL, WELL.

UH, MORNING, FRANK.

"MORNING"?

WHAT WAS... WHAT IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

ARE YOU TRYING TO
SAY MY FAMILY'S POOR?

OH, GEEZ, FRANK.

I DON'T KNOW IF A
KNIFE IS NECESSARY.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, Y-YOU KIND OF
HAD THINGS HANDLED WITHOUT IT.

YOU TELLING ME
HOW TO BULLY NOW?

BIG MISTAKE, MORTY.

AND NOW I'M GONNA CUT YOU,
'CAUSE MY FAMILY'S RICH.

THERE YOU ARE, MORTY.

LISTEN TO ME.

I GOT AN ERRAND TO RUN IN A
WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

I NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.

OH, GEEZ, RICK.

W-WHAT'D YOU DO TO FRANK?

IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS, MORTY.
I FROZE HIM.

NOW LISTEN...
I NEED YOUR HELP, MORTY.

I MEAN, WE GOT...
WE GOT TO GET...

GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
AND GO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.

IT'S IMPORTANT. COME ON, MORTY.

I DON'T KNOW, RICK.

I-I CAN'T LEAVE SCHOOL AGAIN.

DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF HOW
MUCH HIGHER THE STAKES

GET OUT THERE, MORTY?

WHAT DO YOU THINK...
I CAN JUST DO IT ALL BY MYSELF?

COME ON!

AW, GEEZ. OKAY.

I GUESS I CAN SKIP HISTORY.

WHAT ABOUT FRANK?

I MEAN, SHOULDN'T
YOU UNFREEZE HIM?

I'LL DO IT LATER, MORTY.

HE'LL BE FINE.

LET'S GO.

OH, MY GOD.

I'M ABOUT TO WALK
PAST FRANK PALICKY.

THIS IS THE STORY WE'LL
BE TELLING OUR CHILDREN.

HI, FRANK.

AAH!

SCALPEL.

KNOCK, KNOCK.

JERRY?

MY MANAGER GAVE ME AN HOUR
FOR LUNCH, AND I THOUGHT,

"HEY, WHY NOT SWING BY
WHERE YOUR WIFE WORKS? "

WE'RE LOSING HIM.

OKAY, HE'S BACK.

JERRY, PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
HERE FOR AN INCREDIBLY URGENT REASON.

WELL, IT'S LUNCH.

I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THREE MEALS
THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR MILLENNIA.

LOSING HIM.

STABILIZED.

OKAY, I ONLY ASK, JERRY,
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,

MY JOB INVOLVES
PERFORMING HEART SURGERY.

WELL, YEAH, ON HORSES.

EXCUSE ME?

OKAY. LET'S NOT
REHASH THATFIGHT.

I SENSE THAT YOU'RE BUSY
AND WILL NOW BE ON MY WAY.

WHOA!

WHAT IS THIS ON THE FLOOR?

SOME KIND OF LITERATURE FOR
A REALLY NICE-LOOKING NURSING HOME.

HEY, HONEY, CRAZY IDEA...
BAD PITCH...

LET'S PUT YOUR DAD HERE.

LET'S PUT YOUR DAD
IN A NURSING HOME.

WE'RE LOSING HIM.

HEY, TOM.

WE KNOW WHEN
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!

THERE SHE IS. ALL RIGHT.

COME ON, MORTY.
LET'S GO.

OH, GEEZ.

OKAY.

OH, MAN, RICK.

WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

IT'S DIMENSION 35C,
AND IT'S GOT THE PERFECT

CLIMATE CONDITIONS FOR A
SPECIAL TYPE OF TREE, MORTY,

CALLED A MEGA TREE,

AND THERE'S FRUIT
IN THOSE TREES,

AND THERE'S SEEDS
IN THOSE FRUITS.

I'M TALKING ABOUT
MEGA SEEDS.

THEY'RE... THEY'RE
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL,

AND I NEED THEM TO HELP ME
WITH MY RESEARCH, MORTY.

OH, MAN, RICK. I'M LOOKING
AROUND THIS PLACE,

AND I'M STARTING TO WORK UP SOME
ANXIETY ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN.

LISTEN TO ME, MORTY.

I KNOW THAT NEW SITUATIONS
CAN BE INTIMIDATING.

YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND, AND IT'S
ALL SCARY AND DIFFERENT, BUT,

YOU KNOW, M-MEETING THEM HEAD
ON, CHARGING RIGHT INTO THEM

LIKE A BULL...
THAT'S HOW WE GROW AS PEOPLE.

I'M NO STRANGER
TO SCARY SITUATIONS.

I DEAL WITH THEM
ALL THE TIME.

NOW, IF YOU JUST STICK WITH ME,
MORTY, WE'RE GONNA BE...

HOLY CRAP, MORTY, RUN!

I NEVER SEEN THAT THING
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE HELL IT IS!

WE GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE, MORTY!

IT'S GONNA KILL US!

WE'RE GONNA DIE!

WE'RE GONNA DIE, MORTY!

OH, MORTY,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

BREATHE THAT... BREATHE THAT
FRESH AIR IN, MORTY.

Y-YOU SMELL THAT?

THAT'S THE SMELL
OF ADVENTURE, MORTY.

THAT'S... THAT'S THE SMELL OF...
OF... OF... OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT

EVOLUTIONARY TIMELINE.

ALL RIGHT, RICK, LOOK...

HOW MUCH LONGER
IS THIS GONNA BE?

SHOULDN'T I BE
BACK AT SCHOOL BY NOW?

ARE YOU JOKING ME?

I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THE
CRAZY CRAP SURROUNDING US.

LOOK AT THAT THING RIGHT THERE.

W-WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?

YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THAT KIND OF THING AT SCHOOL?

LOOK AT IT JUST
LUMBERING AROUND.

IT DEFIES ALL LOGIC...
THAT THING.

YEAH, RICK, I GET IT.

WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MONSTERS.

THAT'S KIND OF THE REASON
WHY I WANT TO LEAVE.

TA-TA-TA-TA-TA-TA.

MORTY, YOU SEE THIS?

YOU SEE WHAT WE JUST
STUMBLED UPON, MORTY?

ANY IDEA WHAT THAT
IS DOWN THERE?

THE MEGA TREES?

THAT'S RIGHT, MORTY...
THE MEGA TREES

WITH THE MEGA FRUIT ON THEM.

AND THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, MORTY.

THAT'S WHERE MY SEEDS ARE.

IF WE WOULD HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU WANTED,

I WOULD HAVE NEVER
HAVE FOUND THEM,

BECAUSE Y... BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO IN LOVE WITH SCHOOL.

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

SO, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT
THESE SEEDS, ANYWAYS?

YOU ASK A LOT OF
QUESTIONS, MORTY.

NOT VERY CHARISMATIC.

IT MAKES YOU KIND OF
AN UNDER...

UNDERFOOT FIGURE.

JUST TAKE THESE SHOES, MORTY.

THEY'RE SP...
SPECIAL GRAPPLING SHOES.

WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THESE
THINGS... BA... THESE BABIES,

YOU CAN BASICALLY JUST WALK ON
ANY SURFACE YOU WANT, MORTY...

UP, DOWN, BELOW,
TURN AROUND TO THE LEFT.

THESE THINGS REALLY BRING
IT ALL TOGETHER.

AAH!

YOU HAVE TO TURN
THEM ON, MORTY!

THE SHOES HAVE
TO BE TURNED ON!

I AM NOT PUTTING MY FATHER IN A HOME!

HE JUST CAME BACK
INTO MY LIFE,

AND YOU WANT TO GRAB HIM AND
STUFF HIM UNDER A MATTRESS LIKE

LAST MONTH'S VICTORIA'S SECRET?

I TOLD YOU... I WAS ORDERING YOU
SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOUR FATHER IS
A HORRIBLE INFLUENCE ON OUR SON.

EVERYTHING COOL IN HERE, BETH?

IT'S FINE, DAVIN.

OKAY, COOL.

YOU KNOW, WE DID
SOMETHING GREAT TODAY.

THERE'S NOTHING MORE NOBLE AND
FREE THAN THE HEART OF A HORSE.

SINCE WE'RE FIGHTING,
IF YOU EVER HAVE AN AFFAIR

WITH THAT GUY, I WILL
COME TO THE HOTEL ROOM

AND BLOW MY BRAINS OUT
ALL OVER YOUR NAKED BODIES.

LOOK, I APPRECIATE THE
STRESS YOU'RE UNDER, BUT

MORTY WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN
SCHOOL WAY BEFORE MY DAD MOVED

IN, AND THE ONLY INFLUENCE I
CAN SEE RICK HAVING IS THAT,

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE,
MORTY HAS A FRIEND.

WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

UH, YEAH, MAYBE I AM.

I'M MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER.

I'M SMART.

WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M A HEART SURGEON?

HORSE HEART SURGEON.

- HELLO?
- MRS. SMITH?

THIS IS PRINCIPAL VAGINA...
NO RELATION.

I WONDER IF YOU AND MORTY'S
FATHER MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE

A CHAT WITH ME
THIS AFTERNOON?

MORTY, OH, YOU REALLY D-DID A
NUMBER ON YOUR LEGS RIGHT NOW.

YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO
TURN THE SHOES ON, MORTY,

FOR THEM TO WORK.

YEAH, LOOK...
I TURNED MINE ON.

I HAD NO PROBLEM
GETTING DOWN HERE.

IT WAS A LEISURELY BREEZE.

I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN, RICK.

YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

BUT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL STILL BE
ABLE TO HELP ME COLLECT

MY SEEDS, MORTY?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

THAT'S IT, RICK!

THAT'S THE LAST STRAW!

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS...
I'M SITTING HERE WITH BOTH

OF MY LEGS BROKEN,
AND YOU'RE STILL ASKING ME

ABOUT GETTING THOSE SEEDS?!

OOH! OW! OH!

Y-Y-YOU'RE A MONSTER.

Y-YOU'RE LIKE HITLER, BUT...

BUT EVEN HITLER CARED ABOUT
GERMANY OR SOMETHING.

OKAY, HOLD ON JUST A SECOND,
MORTY.

OOH.

OHH.

OOH.

WOW, RICK.

THAT STUFF JUST HEALED
MY BROKEN LEGS INSTANTLY.

I MEAN, I'VE NEVER FELT
SO GOOD IN MY LIFE.

THANK YOU.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MORTY.

JUST COME HELP ME GET THESE
SEEDS, ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

SURE THING, RICK.

NOT THAT YOU ASKED, MORTY,
BUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED

THERE IS I WENT INTO A FUTURE
DIMENSION WITH SUCH ADVANCED

MEDICINE THAT THEY HAD
BROKEN-LEG SERUM AT EVERY

CORNER DRUGSTORE.

THE STUFF WAS ALL OVER
THE PLACE, MORTY.

WOW, THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY, RICK.

THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM,
MORTY...

ONE LITTLE HANG-UP.

THE DIMENSION I VISITED WAS SO
ADVANCED,

THEY HAD ALSO HALTED
THE AGING PROCESS,

AND EVERYONE THERE WAS YOUNG,
MORTY,

AND THEY
HAD BEEN FOREVER.

I WAS THE ONLY OLD
PERSON THERE, MORTY.

IT WAS LIKE I WAS SOME
SORT OF, YOU KNOW, CELEBRITY,

WALKING AROUND.

I-I WAS FASCINATING TO THEM.

THERE WERE A LOT OF ATTRACTIVE
WOMEN THERE, MORTY, AND THEY...

THEY... THEY...
THEY ALL WANTED TIME WITH ME.

I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH
A LOT OF YOUNG LADIES,

BUT I SPENT SO
MUCH TIME THERE,

MY INTERDIMENSIONAL
PORTAL DEVICE...

IT'S GOT NO CHARGE LEFT, MORTY.

IT'S GOT NO CHARGE LEFT.

WHAT?!

IT'S AS GOOD AS
GARBAGE, MORTY.

IT'S NOT GONNA
WORK ANYMORE, MORTY.

OH, GEEZ, RICK,
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

W-WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

I-I HAVE TO BE BACK
AT SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET BACK HOME?

THERE'S WAYS TO
GET BACK HOME, MORTY.

IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST GONNA
BE A LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH
INTERDIMENSIONAL CUSTOMS,

SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO ME A REAL SOLID.

UH-OH.

WHEN WE GET TO CUSTOMS,

I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO TAKE
THESE SEEDS INTO THE BATHROOM,

AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO PUT THEM WAY UP

INSIDE YOUR BUTTHOLE, MORTY.

IN MY BUTT?

PUT THEM WAY UP INSIDE THERE,
AS FAR AS THEY CAN FIT.

OH, GEEZ, RICK.

I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO DO THAT.

WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO DO IT, MORTY.

TH-THESE SEEDS AREN'T GONNA GET
THROUGH CUSTOMS UNLESS THEY'RE

IN SOMEONE'S RECTUM, MORTY.

AND THEY'LL FALL
RIGHT OUT OF MINE.

I'VE DONE THIS
TOO MANY TIMES, MORTY.

I MEAN, YOU'RE YOUNG.

YOU'VE GOT YOUR WHOLE
LIFE AHEAD OF YOU,

AND YOUR ANAL CAVITY IS
STILL TAUT, YET MALLEABLE.

YOU GOT TO DO IT
FOR GRANDPA, MORTY.

Y-YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THESE
SEEDS INSIDE YOUR BUTT.

IN MY BUTT?

COME ON, MORTY.

PLEASE, MORTY.

YOU HAVE TO DO IT, MORTY.

OH, MAN.

THE FACT IS, YOUR SON, MORTY,
HAS ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL FOR A

TOTAL OF SEVEN HOURS OVER
THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

WHAT? WHY DIDN'T
YOU NOTIFY US?

I DONE BEEN NOTIFYING YOU.

HAVE YOU NOT BEEN
GETTING THE MESSAGES

I'VE BEEN LEAVING WITH MORTY'S
GRANDFATHER?

BOOM!

TOLD YOU! IN YOUR FACE!

HE IS RUINING OUR CHILD!

WAIT, WHAT AM I CELEBRATING?

YEAH, SEE, I THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS FISHY THERE,

BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY MORTY'S
GRANDPA THAT'S TAKING

HIM OUT OF SCHOOL.

SUMMER?

WHAT KIND OF GOD LETS THIS HAPPEN?

WE HAD A LITTLE INCIDENT.

A STUDENT WAS
FROZEN TO DEATH.

AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT
A LATINO STUDENT DID IT!

EVERYONE WANTS TO TAKE
THIS TO A RACIAL PLACE.

I WON'T LET THEM.

THE GLARP ZONE IS FOR FLARPING
AND UNGLARPING ONLY.

SO, I TOLD HIM,
"GIVE ME THE BLIMFARX," YOU KNOW?

THIS... THIS GUY...

HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
INTERSTELLAR CURRENCY.

IT'S, LIKE, I'M TRYING
TO EAT A FLIMFLAM...

LIKE, THAT'S WHAT
WE EAT ON GIRVONESK.

THE GLARP ZONE IS FOR
FLARPING AND UNGLARPING ONLY.

I DON'T LIKE IT HERE, MORTY.

I CAN'T ABIDE BUREAUCRACY.

I DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD
WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO.

I CONSIDER IT A VIOLATION.

DID YOU GET THOSE SEEDS
ALL THE WAY UP YOUR BUTT?

YEAH, RICK.

LET'S JUST GET
THIS OVER WITH, OKAY?

I MEAN, THESE THINGS ARE POINTY.
THEY HURT.

THAT MEANS THEY'RE
GOOD ONES.

YOU'RE A GOOD KID, MORTY.

THOSE MEGA SEEDS ARE SUPER
VALUABLE TO MY WORK.

YOU'VE BEEN A HUGE HELP TO ME.

I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO
ALL KINDS OF THINGS WITH THEM.

IT'S GONNA BE GREAT, MORTY.

ALL KINDS OF SCIENCE.

OKAY, NEXT THROUGH.

EXCEPT YOU. YOU GO OVER THERE.

WHY DOES HE HAVE
TO GO OVER THERE?

RANDOM CHECK.

HE'S GOT TO GO THROUGH
THE NEW MACHINE.

WHAT NEW...
WHAT NEW MACHINE?

IT'S A NEW MACHINE.

IT DETECTS STUFF ALL
THE WAY UP YOUR BUTT.

RUN, MORTY! RUN!

AAH!

RED ALERT!

OHHHHH!

HEY! OHHHHHH.

AAH!

DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!

OOH!

OH, NICE, MORTY!

THE STUDENT BECOMES
THE TEACHER.

WHOOOOOO!

AAH!

AW, HELL, NO, DAWG.

YOU KNOW ME...
I'M JUST TRYING TO...

AAH!

I NEED TO TYPE IN THE COORDINATES
TO OUR HOME WORLD, MORTY.

COVER ME.
- OH, MAN.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I-I
DON'T WANT TO SHOOT NOBODY.

THEY'RE JUST ROBOTS, MORTY!

IT'S OKAY TO SHOOT THEM!

THEY'RE ROBOTS!

AAH!

MY LEG IS SHOT OFF!

GLENN'S BLEEDING TO DEATH!

SOMEONE CALL HIS WIFE
AND CHILDREN!

THEY'RE NOT ROBOTS, RICK!

IT'S A FIGURE OF
SPEECH, MORTY.

THEY'RE BUREAUCRATS.

I DON'T RESPECT THEM.

JUST KEEP SHOOTING, MORTY.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
PRISON IS LIKE HERE!

HOLY CRAP!
THIS IS INSANE!

COME ON, MORTY!

WE GOT TO GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE!

WOW.

DID YOU JUST COME INTO THE
CAFETERIA THROUGH A PORTAL?

UH, YEAH.

WELL, YOU KNOW, MY... MY
FERRARI'S IN THE SHOP.

JU... JUST KIDDING.

YOU'RE MORTY, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

YOU CAN GET
HIS NUMBER LATER.

COME ON, MORTY. WE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

YOU GOT TO GET THOSE
SEEDS OUT OF YOUR ASS.

OH, LOOK, HONEY.

IT'S OUR SON WITH
ALBERT EIN-DOUCHE.

WHAT?

I'M AN ANGRY FATHER,
NOT AN IMPROVISOR.

OH, HI, JERRY.

OH, MY GOODNESS, MORTY!

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT OF CLASS?

WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

YOUR... YOUR PARENTS AND
I ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN...

IN THIS BEHAVIOR.

NO? NO TAKERS?

YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY NOT
BE TOUCHING THAT STUFF.

IT'S BEYOND YOUR REASONING.

YOU'RE BEYOND OUR REASONING!

TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

DAD, HOW COULD YOU MAKE MY
SON MISS AN ENTIRE SEMESTER OF SCHOOL?

I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S A HOT GIRL.

HE CAN'T JUST BAIL ON
HIS LIFE AND SET UP SHOP

IN SOMEONE ELSE'S.

WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING WITH MY STUFF?

WE'RE MOVING YOU...
TO A NURSING HOME.

A NURSING HOME?

WHAT ARE...
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

I'M A GENIUS.

I BUILD ROBOTS FOR FUN.

WELL, NOW YOU CAN BUILD BASKETS
AND WATCH PAUL NEWMAN MOVIES

ON VHS AND MENTALLY SCAR THE
BOY SCOUTS EVERY CHRISTMAS.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

IT'S PERSONAL.

DAD, MOM, C-COME ON.

RICK JUST NEEDED
MY HELP IS ALL.

MORTY, STAY OUT OF THIS.

YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT CAPABLE
OF JUDGING THESE SITUATIONS ON YOUR OWN.

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY ABOUT MORTY?

THAT HE'S STUPID
OR SOMETHING?

OH, DON'T HIGH-ROAD US, DAD.

YOU KNOW FULLY WELL THAT MORTY
IS THE LAST CHILD THAT NEEDS TO

BE MISSING CLASSES.

I-I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN BY THAT.

CAN... CAN... CAN YOU BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC?

OH, FOR CRYING OUT...

HE'S GOT SOME KIND OF
DISABILITY OR SOMETHING.

IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT US TO SAY?

I DO?

WELL, DUH DOY, SON.

LOOK, I LOVE YOU, MORTY, BUT WE
BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT AS FAST AS

THE OTHER KIDS, AND IF YOU
WANT TO COMPETE IN THIS WORLD,

YOU GOT TO WORK
TWICE AS HARD.

AW, GEEZ, DAD.

Y-YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT
TO DROP ON A KID ALL AT ONCE.

MORTY, T-TELL YOUR PARENTS
THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI.

OH, COME ON, RICK.

YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI,
MORTY... GO.

1.77245385.

WHOA!

WHAT THE HELL?

HOLY CRAP. HE'S RIGHT.

MORTY, TELL YOUR PARENTS
THE FIRST LAW OF

THERMODYNAMICS.

"THE INCREMENT IN THE INTERNAL
ENERGY OF A SYSTEM IS EQUAL TO

THE INCREMENT OF HEAT
SUPPLIED TO THE SYSTEM."

WOW! I'M SO SMART!

BUT...

I TOLD THE BOTH OF YOU...

SCHOOL IS STUPID.

IT'S NOT HOW YOU LEARN THINGS.

MORTY'S A GIFTED CHILD.

HE HAS A SPECIAL MIND.

THAT'S WHY HE'S
MY LITTLE HELPER.

HE'S LIKE ME.

HE'S GONNA BE DOING GREAT
SCIENCE STUFF LATER IN HIS LIFE.

HE'S TOO SMART FOR SCHOOL.

H-HE NEEDS TO KEEP HANGING OUT
AND HELPING ME.

JERRY, I DON'T WANT WHATEVER'S
HAPPENING HERE TO STOP.

NO, I-I UNDERSTAND.

UH, MAYBE WE OVERREACTED.

BUT HE HAS TO KEEP
GOING TO SCHOOL.

OKAY, JERRY.

YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN,

BUT WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

SAY... SAY NO?

YOU... YOU REALLY WEAR
THE PANTS AROUND HERE.

I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,
BETWEEN US, FROM NOW ON,

IT'S GONNA BE 100%
HONESTY AND OPEN,

CLEAR COMMUNICATION.

FRANK PALICKY WAS
FROZEN TO DEATH TODAY!

NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

OKAY.

WELL, UH, MORTY,
IT'S YOUR BEDTIME IN AN HOUR.

DON'T STAY UP
ALL NIGHT AGAIN.

THIS IS GOOD, THOUGH.

THIS CAN WORK.

I THINK WE CAN BE A FAMILY.

AND NOW, BETH,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME,

I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

OKAY.

HOLY COW, RICK.

I DIDN'T KNOW HANGING OUT WITH
YOU WAS MAKING ME SMARTER.

FULL DISCLOSURE, MORTY...
IT'S NOT.

TEMPORARY SUPERINTELLIGENCE IS
JUST A SIDE EFFECT OF THE

MEGA SEEDS DISSOLVING IN
YOUR RECTAL CAVITY.

AW, MAN.

YEAH, AND ONCE THOSE
SEEDS WEAR OFF,

YOU'RE GONNA LOSE MOST
OF YOUR MOTOR SKILLS,

AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA LOSE
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

BRAIN FUNCTIONALITY
FOR 72 HOURS, MORTY.

STARTING
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

OHH, MAN.

OH, GEEZ! OHH.

I'M SORRY, MORTY.
IT'S A BUMMER.

IN REALITY, YOU'RE
AS DUMB AS THEY COME.

AND I NEEDED THOSE
SEEDS REAL BAD,

AND I HAD TO GIVE THEM UP JUST
TO GET YOUR PARENTS OFF MY BACK,

SO NOW WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO GET MORE.

AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO ON EVEN
MORE ADVENTURES AFTER THAT,

MORTY.

AND YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR MOUTH
SHUT ABOUT IT, MORTY,

BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FULL OF
IDIOTS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT'S IMPORTANT,

AND THEY'LL TEAR US APART,
MORTY.

BUT IF YOU STICK WITH ME, I'M
GONNA ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS,

MORTY, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
PART OF THEM, AND TOGETHER,

WE'RE GONNA RUN AROUND, MORTY.

WE'RE GONNA DO ALL KINDS OF
WONDERFUL THINGS, MORTY.

JUST YOU AND ME, MORTY.

OH, NO, NO.

THE OUTSIDE WORLD
IS OUR ENEMY, MORTY.

WE'RE THE ONLY
FRIENDS WE'VE GOT, MORTY.

IT'S JUST RICK AND MORTY...

RICK AND MORTY
AND THEIR ADVENTURES, MORTY.

RICK AND MORTY FOREVER
AND FOREVER.

100 YEARS,
RICK AND MORTY'S THINGS.

ME AND RICK AND MORTY RUNNING
AROUND, AND RICK AND MORTY TIME.

ALL DAY LONG, FOREVER.

ALL... A HUNDRED DAYS.

RICK AND MORTY FOREVER...
100 TIMES.

OVER AND OVER,
RICKANDMORTYADVENTURES.COM.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE=14>WWW.TVSUBTITLES.NET</FONT>
HEY, RICK.

I HAVE TO MAKE A PROJECT FOR
THE SCIENCE FAIR THIS WEEKEND.

YOU THINK YOU COULD
HELP ME OUT?

- WHATEVER.
- WELL, I MEAN, TRADITIONALLY...

SCIENCE FAIRS ARE
A FATHER-SON THING.

WELL, SCIENTIFICALLY,
TRADITIONS ARE AN IDIOT THING.

MORTY, I THINK IT WOULD
BE FUN FOR YOU

TO WORK ON A SCIENCE PROJECT
WITH YOUR DAD.

UH...

YEAH, DAD.
WHY DON'T WE DO IT TOGETHER?

YES! YOU BACKED THE RIGHT HORSE
ON THIS ONE, SON.

WE'LL GET OUT THE CRAYONS,
BREW SOME COFFEE,

AND KNOCK THIS THING OUT
IN TWO OR THREE DAYS.

WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?

PASS THE BUTTER.

THANK YOU.

DAD, I NEED A RIDE
TO WORK.

MAYBE RICK CAN GIVE
YOU A RIDE.

I'M HELPING MORTY
WITH SCIENCE.

- I'M BUSY.
- DOING WHAT?

UH, ANYTHING ELSE.

WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?

YOU PASS BUTTER.

OH, MY GOD.

YEAH, WELCOME
TO THE CLUB, PAL.

SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE
A JOB?

SINCE LAST WEEK.

IT'S PART-TIME AT THIS
LITTLE VINTAGE THRIFT STORE.

MY BOSS IS THIS REALLY
SMART, ECCENTRIC OLD MAN

THAT TREATS ME NICE
AND VALUES ME.

MEOW.
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET...

THIS
FASCINATING CHARACTER.

PLEASE DON'T.

OH. WELL, WHEN DID THIS
STOP BEING JAMBA JUICE?

I'VE JUST RECENTLY OPENED
FOR BUSINESS,

MISTER, UM, GOLDENFOLD.

YOU KNOW MY NAME?

THAT'S DISARMING.

I ALSO KNOW YOU LONG
FOR FEMALE COMPANY.

YOU KNOW, IT HAS BEEN
LONELY SINCE THE DIVORCE.

SOME VOIDS CAN'T BE FILLED
WITH JAMBA JUICE.

THIS AFTERSHAVE MAKES A
MAN QUITE IRRESISTIBLE TO WOMEN.

FREE OF CHARGE.

ONE NEVER PAYS HERE...
NOT WITH MONEY.

NOTHING TO READ INTO
THERE. THANKS!

SORRY I'M LATE,
MR. NEEDFUL.

THIS IS MY GRANDPA, RICK.
HE WAS JUST LEAVING.

HUH.

TELL ME, RICK,
WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?

EH, I MAKE MY OWN STUFF.

SO, WHAT ARE YOU...
LIKE, THE DEVIL?

- WHAT? SORRY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

STORE COMES OUT OF NOWHERE,
ALL THE SHIT'S OLD AND CREEPY.

ARE YOU THE DEVIL?
A DEMON? LEPRECHAUN?

- GRANDPA RICK!
- HEY, I'M NOT JUDGING.

JUST LIKE SHOOT STRAIGHT.
I'M A MAN OF SCIENCE.

AH, THEN PERHAPS YOU COULD
MAKE USE OF THIS.

THIS MICROSCOPE REVEALS THINGS
BEYOND COMPREHENSION.

GRANDPA, GO HOME
AND DRINK.

WHY DON'T WE DO A MODEL
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

THAT'S WHAT MY DAD DID WITH ME
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

OH, OKAY.

YOU KNOW, RICK'S IN HIS LAB,
MAKING CYBORGS

AND WORMHOLES
AND ALL THAT WEIRD STUFF,

BUT THIS IS REAL SCIENCE.

A MAN AND HIS BOY,
MAKING PLANETS.

HEY, HOW ABOUT WE USE
A PING-PONG BALL FOR PLUTO?

AND THEN JUPITER...

UH, ACTUALLY, I DON'T
THINK PLUTO'S A PLANET.

OF COURSE PLUTO'S
A PLANET, SON.

I LEARNED THAT
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU
KNOW THEY CHANGED IT.

MORTY, NOBODY CHANGED
THE PLANETS.

I JUST GOOGLED IT.
PLUTO'S NOT A PLANET.

THEY CHANGED IT IN 2006.

YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT
THAT, MORTY.

AND I DISAGREE.
- YOU DISAGREE?

THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S POSSIBLE
TO DISAGREE IN SCIENCE, MORTY.

PLUTO WAS A PLANET.

SOME COMMITTEE OF
FANCY ASSHOLES DISAGREE.

I DISAGREE BACK.
GIVE ME A PING-PONG BALL.

UM, OKAY.
I-I JUST HAVE TO...

GO FIND RICK AND GO
OVER MY HEAD ABOUT PLUTO?

NO. GEEZ!

I JUST GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM. DAMN.

OH.
OKAY, GOOD.

THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

HEY, MORTY, LET ME...
LET ME...

LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
REAL QUICK.

DOES EVIL EXIST,
AND IF SO,

CAN ONE DETECT AND MEASURE IT?

- UM...
- RHETORICAL QUESTION, MORTY.

THE ANSWER'S "YES, YOU JUST
HAVE TO BE A GENIUS."

CUTE. YOUR SISTER'S BOSS
GAVE ME A MICROSCOPE

THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE ME RETARDED.

OOH.
OH, BOY, RICK.

I'M DON'T THINK YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO SAY THAT WORD, YOU KNOW?

MORTY, I'M NOT DISPARAGING
THE DIFFERENTLY ABLED.

I'M STATING THE FACT THAT
IF I HAD USED THIS MICROSCOPE,

IT WOULD HAVE MADE ME
MENTALLY RETARDED.

OKAY, YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S ABOUT LOGIC, RICK.

I THINK THE WORD HAS JUST
BECOME A SYMBOLIC ISSUE FOR

POWERFUL GROUPS THAT ARE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

WELL, THAT'S RETARDED.

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- APPARENTLY, NOTHING.

YOU ASKED HIM IF
PLUTO'S A PLANET, DIDN'T YOU?

- NO!
- IT'S NOT.

- SHUT UP, RICK.
- WHOA.

I DON'T CARE WHAT
ANYONE SAYS.

IF IT CAN BE A PLANET,
IT CAN BE A PLANET AGAIN.

PLANET.
PLANET, PLANET, PLANET.

STAY SCIENTIFIC, JERRY.

THIS AFTERSHAVE MADE WOMEN
WANT ME,

BUT IT ALSO MADE ME
IMPOTENT!

A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING,
MR. GOLDENFOLD.

A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING.

OH, MY GOD!

HOW COULD I NOT
SEE THIS COMING?!

MY LUST!

MY GREED!

I DESERVED THIS!

THIS SERUM SHOULD
COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

HOLY CATS!
LADIES, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

I HAVEN'T LEARNED A THING!

HERE.

YOU CAN HAVE
THIS BACK.

YOU DIDN'T USE IT?

SURE I DID...
TO DEVELOP THIS.

IT DETECTS AND CATALOGS
ALL YOUR "TWILIGHT ZONE,"

RAY BRADBURY,
"FRIDAY THE 13TH" THE SERIES

VOODOO CRAP MAGIC.

I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT IT SO YOU DIDN'T

ACCIDENTALLY
SELL ANYBODY, SAY...

A TYPEWRITER THAT GENERATES
BEST-SELLING MURDER MYSTERIES

AND THEN MAKES THE MURDERS
HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE?

OOH.
- BE QUIET.

DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
GETTING?

YOU'RE NOT INTENTIONALLY
SELLING...

BEAUTY CREAM THAT MAKES
UGLY LADIES PRETTY

BUT ALSO MAKES
THEM BLIND?

I FIND THIS ALL QUITE
PREPOSTEROUS.

OH, I SAY, GOOD SIR.
OH, HARRUMPH.

OH, OH!

THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE WEARING
YOU IN THREE HOURS?

DO I NEED TO CALL THE POLICE?

HERE, YOU CAN USE

MAKE YOU DEAF

BECAUSE I'M NOT A HACK.

HEY!

SO GREAT!

STOP IT! NO!

FUCK YEAH, MAN.

STOP IT RIGHT NOW!

GRANDPA RICK,
I LIKE WORKING HERE.

- YOU WORK FOR THE DEVIL.
- SO WHAT?

- "SO WHAT?"
- YES!

SO WHAT
IF HE'S THE DEVIL, RICK?

AT LEAST THE DEVIL
HAS A JOB.

AT LEAST HE'S ACTIVE
IN THE COMMUNITY.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

YOU EAT OUR FOOD
AND MAKE GADGETS.

BUH-BYE.

WHOOPS.

I'M SORRY, MR. NEEDFUL.
I'LL CLEAN THAT UP.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT THE GHOST LADY

THAT CAME OUT OF IT, BUT...
- IT'S FINE.

SUMMER, YOU KNOW,
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S RIGHT.

THIS STORE CURSES PEOPLE.
THAT'S MY BUSINESS.

WELL, YEAH.
FAST-FOOD GIVES PEOPLE DIABETES,

AND CLOTHING STORES HAVE
SWEATSHOPS.

IS THERE A COMPANY HIRING
TEENAGERS THAT ISN'T EVIL?

THIS IS MY FIRST JOB.

YOU'VE BEEN NICE TO ME,
MR. NEEDFUL.

YOU RESPECT ME.

PLEASE, CALL ME "THE DEVIL."

I'D RATHER NOT,
ACTUALLY.

YES, PERHAPS NOT DURING
BUSINESS HOURS.

I TOLD YOU, I WANT TO
FILE A DECLARATION

THAT PLUTO IS A PLANET.

WELL, THEN MY SON'S GOING TO
FAIL HIS SCIENCE CLASS,

AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
I'M SUING YOU FIRST.

I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE "A"
IN N.A.S.A. STANDS FOR.

- DAD, WHAT'S YOUR ENDGAME?
- AIN'T NO GAME, SUCKA.

WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE THE SOLAR
SYSTEM WITH EIGHT PLANETS?

IT'S EVEN EASIER.

SURE, SURE, AND WHY DON'T WE
JUST BURN GALILEO AT THE STAKE

FOR SAYING THE SUN
IS ROUND?

SCIENCE ISN'T ALWAYS EASY,
MORTY.

WHOA! WHOA!

WHAT THE HELL?!

I'M KING FLIPPY NIPS,
RULER OF PLUTO.

WE DISCOVERED YOU QUITE
BY ACCIDENT

DURING ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE
OF YOUR WORLD.

YOU REALLY GAVE IT TO THOSE
GUYS AT N.A.S.A.

I WAS... YOU KNOW,

SOMETIMES SCIENCE IS
ABOUT CONVICTION.

IT'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO A FEW PEOPLE

THAT VERY MUCH AGREE
WITH YOU.

OH, I...

PLUTONIANS.

JERRY SMITH IS A SCIENTIST
FROM EARTH,

WHERE HE'S CREATING A MODEL
OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

JERRY, TELL PLUTO
ABOUT YOUR DECISION.

UM... PLUTO'S A PLANET.

PLUTO'S A FUCKING
PLANET, BITCH!

OH, MAN. THIS IS DEFINITELY
GONNA GO TO HIS HEAD.

IF IT'S ATHLETIC PROWESS
YOU DESIRE, PRINCIPAL VAGINA,

I MIGHT...
- I'LL TAKE IT.

B-BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN...

THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

GREAT STORE.
GREAT PLACE. BYE.

HUH. OKAY.

I MUST SAY, SUMMER, I THOUGHT
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S OUTBURST

WOULD HAVE DISRUPTED BUSINESS,

BUT THIS IS THE BEST WEEKEND
I'VE HAD SINCE SALEM.

NICE. "WHOLESOME DELIGHT"
FOR LUNCH?

- IS THAT THE VEGAN PLACE?
- YEAH, I LOVE THEIR SOUP.

I'M KIND OF SOUP-ED OUT.

MRS. TATE, IS IT?

WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?

WHOA, WHOA, SLOW DOWN,
HONEY.

OH, IS THERE A LIMIT?
EVERYTHING'S FREE, RIGHT?

LET'S JUST SAY YOU
DON'T PAY... WITH MONEY.

THAT WAS PERFECT.

YOU PAY WITH THE CURSES,
RIGHT?

UM... I... WELL...

BUT, MRS. TATE, WHY DO YOU
WANT CURSED ITEMS?

WELL, I'M GOING TO GET
THE CURSES REMOVED

AT "CURSE PURGE PLUS."

YOU KNOW, THE GUY ON TV?

WHAT?

HAVE YOU ACQUIRED
CREEPY SPECIFIC OLD STUF

FROM A MYSTERIOUS ANTIQUE
OR THRIFT STORE

THAT GIVES YOU POWERS
BUT FUCKS WITH YOU

IN UNFORESEEABLE WAYS?

BRING IT
TO "CURSE PURGE PLUS."

I USE SCIENCE TO
UN-CURSE THE ITEMS FOR CASH,

AND YOU GET TO KEEP
THE POWERS.

THIS GUY GOT MYSTERIOUS
SNEAKERS

TO MAKE HIM RUN FASTER,
BUT GUESS WHAT?

HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO RUN
UNTIL HE DIED,

MAKING THEM WORTHLESS.

I REMOVED THE CURSE,
MAKING THEM WORTH,

LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
8 MILLION.

SEE YOU AT THE OLYMPICS.

THIS EERILY INTELLIGENT DOLL

WAS THREATENING TO MURDER
ITS FAMILY.

NOW IT DOES THEIR TAXES.

EVERYTHING'S DEDUCTIBLE.

DON'T PAY FOR COOL STUFF
WITH YOUR SOUL.

PAY FOR IT WITH MONEY.

YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW EVERY OTHER
STORE IN THE WORLD WORKS?

WE'RE LOCATED AT FIRST AND MAIN
IN OLD TOWN.

COME ON... COME ON DOWN.

"FIRST AND..."

THAT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM "NEEDFUL THINGS,"

WHERE YOU CAN GET EVIL ITEMS
FOR FREE!

DIABOLIC SON OF A MOTHERF...

WE'RE BACK ON
"GOOD MORNING, PLUTO."

AND A VERY GOOD MORNING IT IS

FOR OUR GUEST,
EARTH SCIENTIST JERRY SMITH,

WHO'S MAKING HEADLINES
WITH HIS BOLD ANNOUNCEMENT

THAT IS WHAT, JERRY?

PLUTO IS A PLANET.

WELL, HOW ABOUT THAT.

I LOVE IT.

MORTY SMITH.
I'M SCROOPY NOOPERS.

I'M A SCIENTIST.
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

UH, I BETTER NOT.

RIGHT NOW.

THE CENTER OF PLUTO,
MR. SMITH,

IS MADE OF A SUBSTANCE CALLED
"PLUTONIUM."

MINES LIKE THESE SUCK PLUTONIUM
UP TO THE CITIES,

WHERE CORPORATIONS USE IT
TO POWER EVERYTHING,

FROM DIAMOND CARS
TO GOLDEN SHOWERS.

AND THE MORE WE REMOVE,
THE MORE PLUTO SHRINKS.

THERE IT GOES AGAIN.

JUST SHRANK A LITTLE.

BUT A FEW YEARS AGO,

YOUR SCIENTISTS NOTICED PLUTO
HAD GOTTEN SO SMALL

THEY COULDN'T EVEN CALL IT
A "PLANET" ANYMORE.

SHOULD'VE BEEN
OUR WAKE-UP CALL.

BUT THE RICH PLUTONIANS
WON'T WAKE UP,

AND THEY LOVE YOUR DAD TELLING
EVERYONE PLUTO'S A PLANET

BECAUSE THAT MEANS
THEY CAN KEEP MINING

UNTIL PLUTO GOES
FROM PLANET TO ASTEROID

TO METEOR, AND FINALLY...

POOF.
- UM, A PARTY?

IS EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY
AN IDIOT?

WELL, FOR SURE
ME AND MY DAD ARE.

WELL, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

IS GET HIM TO ADMIT THAT,

AND YOU COULD SAVE
FOUR BILLION LIVES.

YEAH, YOU KNOW, THE THING IS
MY DAD'S REALLY INSECURE.

HMM. FUNNY.

MR. NEEDFUL, OUT OF EVERYTHING
IN THE STORE,

YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT WE COULDN'T GET RID OF.

OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD.

I WISH THIS DESK WAS
LIGHTER.

I WISH THIS KNOT WAS LOOSER.

COME ON.

I DON'T...

WAIT, WHAT AM I DOING?

I WISH I KNEW CPR.

1, 2, 3.

OH, JESUS.

WHAT A WASTE OF A MONKEY PAW.

MR. NEEDFUL, HOW
COULD YOU EVEN THINK OF DOING

SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE?

I'M THE DEVIL.
WHAT SHOULD I DO

WHEN I FAIL...
GET MYSELF AN ICE CREAM?

YOU HAVEN'T FAILED.

PEOPLE LIKE RICK
ARE MAKING ME OBSOLETE.

I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
I MAY BE "THE DEVIL,"

BUT YOUR GRANDPA IS
THE DEVIL.

I JUST WANT TO GO
BACK TO HELL,

WHERE EVERYONE THINKS
I'M SMART AND FUNNY.

NO!
IT'S NOT FAIR.

EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
GOT SOMETHING THEY WANTED

FROM YOU... EVEN RICK.

I WAS YOUR ONLY FRIEND,
AND I GET NOTHING?

OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE THING.
NAME IT.

I WANT TO HELP YOU.

CLEVER TWIST.

I LEARNED FROM
THE BEST, YOU OLD FART.

NOW, LET'S GO GET YOU
HYDRATED.

LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT...

HAUNTED BOXING GLOVES
THAT WILL MAKE YOU

THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
IN 1936,

AND THEN YOU'LL BE
TRAPPED THERE,

WINNING THE SAME FIGHT
FOR ETERNITY.

I CAN TAKE OUT THE "ETERNITY"
AND THE PADDING,

AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE SOME
TIME-TRAVELING MITTENS.

OH, LOOK,
IT'S ROSEMARY'S BABY.

HOW'S BUSINESS?

HERE'S THE LAST
OF OUR INVENTORY.

WE'RE GOING TO FILE CHAPTER 11
AND DO SOME RESTRUCTURING.

SOUNDS LIKE CODE FOR
"YOU WIN, RICK."

THAT WAS IMPORTANT
TO YOU, WASN'T IT?

NOPE. IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO YOUR DUMB DEVIL FRIEND.

TO ME, THIS WAS ALL
JUST A BIT,

LIKE WHEN BUGS BUNNY FUCKS
WITH THE OPERA SINGER

FOR 20 MINUTES.

HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF.

SERIOUSLY? HOLY CRAP.

HOLY CRAP.

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRANDPA RICK?

HE'S STRONG, AND HE'S NEVER
GOING TO GIVE UP.

- UH-HUH, YEAH, I DON'T CARE.
- OH, I KNOW.

- EVERYONE KNOWS YOU DON'T CARE.
- SO?

SO HAVE FUN NOT
CARING.

- I ALWAYS DO.
- GOOD.

YEAH, IT IS GOOD.
IT'S THE BEST.

I'M SURE IT IS.

- BYE.
- LATER.

I'M HERE TO PICK UP
MY UNDEAD CAT AND CHILD.

YEAH, UH...
GIVE ME A SEC.

THESE ARE THE FORMS
FOR THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN.

ALL RIGHT, YEAH, PUT...
PUT THEM ON MY... EH.

I JUST GOT BORED.

EVERYBODY OUT.

ALL RIGHT, JUST ONE MORE RALLY,

THEN I PROMISE WE'LL GET BACK
TO YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT.

DAD, PLUTO ISN'T
A PLANET.

IT'S SHRINKING BECAUSE
OF CORPORATIONS.

YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THAT
ANTI-PLANET NUT JOB

SCROOPY NOOPERS WAS
SCREAMING ABOUT

OUTSIDE THE MINISTRY OF MONEY'S
FUNDRAISER.

ARE YOU TELLING ME FOUR BILLION
PLUTONIANS ARE WRONG?

YOU SAID SCIENCE
WASN'T EASY.

I SAID SCIENCE
ISN'T ALWAYS EASY.

OBVIOUSLY, THAT MEANS
SOMETIMES IT IS EASY.

LET'S NOT DEBASE OURSELVES
WITH WORD GAMES, SON.

DAD, THEIR WHOLE
PLANET IS DYING.

HA! YOU CALLED IT A PLANET.
CHECKMATE.

WHAT'S UP, PLUTO?

MR. SMITH, PLEASE TELL
MY FRIEND HERE

WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME.
GO ON.

MY VERY EAGER MOTHER
JUST SERVED US NINE PICKLES,

AND THE "PICKLES"
IS PLUTO.

MY GOD, THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

UM, EXCUSE ME.

MORTY, WHAT?

DAD, WHAT DID YOU
THINK ABOUT THE RECENT REPORT

PUBLISHED BY
THE PLUTO SCIENCE READER

LINKING PLUTO-QUAKES, SINKHOLES,
AND SURFACE SHRINKAGE

TO DEEP-CORE PLUTONIUM

WELL, SON, WHAT DID
YOU THINK

WHEN YOU WERE FIVE
AND YOU POOPED YOUR PANTS,

AND YOU THREW YOUR POOPY UNDIES
OUT YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW

BECAUSE YOU
THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE

THROWING SOMETHING
IN THE GARBAGE?

I MEAN, I'M TRIMMING

AND THESE THINGS ARE JUST
HANGING THERE.

THE HIGHEST HONOR

RECEIVE.

I'M FLATTERED AND HUMBLED.

OH, I LIKE THAT.

ALSO, TALK ABOUT PLUTO

OOH, LOOK WHO'S LITTLE

YOU CAN'T KILL THE TRUTH,

- WHAT?
- I CAN SEE YOU'RE CONFUSED.

PLUTO-NAMO BAY IS
A MILITARY PRISON...

A SORT OF PLAY ON WORDS.

DID HE CALL YOU
"FATHER"?

SCROOPY NOOPERS,

- IT'S A WHAT?
- HUH? OH, PLANET.

"PLUTO IS A COLD,

THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

- HEY, MORTY.
- OH, OH, HEY, DAD.

UM, WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING

UH... SOME PEOPLE JUST
CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

ESPECIALLY DUMMIES LIKE ME.

MORTY, I'M NOT AS SMART
AS YOUR GRANDPA RICK,

BUT I PROMISE NEVER TO MAKE
THAT YOUR PROBLEM AGAIN.

HEY, DAD.

NOBODY'S SMARTER THAN RICK,
BUT NOBODY ELSE IS MY DAD.

YOU'RE A GENIUS AT THAT.

WOW.

- HE DUMPED ME.
- OOF. SORRY.

DID WE LEARN A LESSON HERE

NOT SURE.

BOTH WHAT WE REALLY WANTED?

BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS JEALOUS OF

WE LIVE OUR LIVES
IN HIDING.

I GUESS I SHOULD
BE HAPPY FOR YOU.

I MEAN, GREAT,
YOU GUYS GOT TO HANG OUT.

I HOPE YOU HAD
A BLAST.

THE GALACTIC GOVERNMENT
CONSIDERS US TERRORISTS.

IT'S UNWISE OF ME
TO SHARE THESE DETAILS,

BUT I'VE
BECOME INEBRIATED.

I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN APPRECIATE

WHAT IT MEANS TO GROW UP
WITHOUT A FATHER, BUT --

THE GUEST LIST
AT THIS WEDDING

INCLUDES 17 OF THE FEDERATION'S
MOST WANTED.

WE HAVE COMMITTED
NUMEROUS ATROCITIES

IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM.

ANNND DURING THAT TIME,

I DON'T SUPPOSE HE
EVER MENTIONED HIS DAUGHTER.

ARE THOSE BABY QUICHES?

NIGHT CRAWLER PATE.

I SHOULD PREPARE
FOR THE CEREMONY.

LIKE TALKING
TO A BRICK WALL.

[ SQUAWKING ]

IN THE NAME OF THE SQUANCH,
THE SIX RIVERS,

THE FOUR SQUANCHES,
AND THE NINE BALLS,

I UNITE THESE TWO ORGANISMS
IN ETERNAL SQUANCH!

TAMMY, YOU MAY
SQUANCH YOUR VOWS NOW.

BIRDPERSON...
[ INHALES SHARPLY ]

YOU ARE MY SEED,
MY WORM, MY EARLINESS,

AND MY LACK OF CATS.

I PROMISE TO BE YOURS
UNTIL YOUR DEATH.

NICE!
ALL: AWW!

BIRDPERSON.

TAMMY, I WAS APPROACHING
INFERTILITY WHEN I MET YOU,

BUT THERE IS STILL TIME.

I AM YOURS
UNTIL MY DEATH.

ALL: AWW!

[ BURPING ]
AWW.

I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
SQUANCH AND BIRDPERSON!

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
AND PROFANE KISSING ]

♪ GIRL, YOU GOT IT GOING ON

[ CHILDREN LAUGHING ]

[ MONOTONE ]
I AM NOT STARING AT YOU.

I AM A CYBORG PHOTOGRAPHER.
JUST ACT NATURAL.

THIS IS A CANDID SHOT.

I DON'T REQUIRE
A CAMERA SO --

SORRY.

HI.
I AM NOT STARING AT YOU.

[ SCREAMS ]

[ CLINKING ]

UH, HI, EVERYBODY.

I'M RI[BURPS]CK.

YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
MET BIRDPERSON, HE WAS, UHH...

LISTEN, I'M NOT THE NICEST GUY
IN THE UNIVERSE

BECAUSE I'M THE SMARTEST.

AND BEING NICE IS SOMETHING
STUPID PEOPLE DO

TO HEDGE THEIR BETS.

NOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN
EXACTLY SUBTLE

ABOUT HOW LITTLE
I TRUST MARRIAGE.

I COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK,

AND I COULD TURN A BLACK HOLE
INTO A SUN,

SO AT A CERTAIN POINT,
YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF

WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THIS IS LEGIT

AND NOT JUST SOME BIG LIE
WE'RE ALL TELLING OURSELVES

BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID
TO DIE ALONE?

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
EXACTLY HOW WE ALL DIE -- ALONE.

OH, BOY.
OH, DAD.

JESUS.

BUT -- BUT...
HERE'S THE THING.

BIRDPERSON IS MY BEST FRIEND,

AND IF HE LOVES TAMMY, WELL,
THEN I LOVE TAMMY, TOO.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

TO FRIENDSHIP, TO LOVE, AND
TO MY GREATEST ADVENTURE YET --

OPENING MYSELF UP
TO OTHERS.

SUMMER: HEAR, HEAR!
CHEERS!

CHEERS TO THAT,
MOTHER[BLEEP]

THANK YOU, RICK.

THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

GOSH, I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM,
AND I THINK,

"UH, TAMMY,
YOU'RE A HIGH-SCHOOL SENIOR

FROM THE PLANET EARTH,
AND YOU'RE MARRYING

A 40-YEAR-OLD BIRDPERSON?
LIKE, WHAT?!"

[ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH, TAMMY!

BUT THEN I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

I'M NOT A HIGH-SCHOOL SENIOR
FROM THE PLANET EARTH.

IN A LOT OF WAYS,
WHAT I REALLY AM

IS A DEEP-COVER AGENT
FOR THE GALACTIC FEDERATION,

AND YOU GUYS ARE
A GROUP OF WANTED CRIMINALS,

AND THIS ENTIRE BUILDING IS,
IN A CERTAIN SENSE, SURROUNDED.

[ ALL MURMUR ]
OH, SHIT.

I...DON'T GET
THE METAPHOR.

I'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU LATER.

EVERYONE HERE IS
UNDER ARREST

FOR CRIMES
AGAINST THE FEDERATION.

TAMMY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

SIT YOUR
BIRD ASS DOWN.

TAMMY?

[ CAWING WEAKLY ]

AAAH!!

[ SIRENS WAILING ]

GOD DAMN IT!
GOD DAMN IT!!

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
BACK THERE?!

THIS IS ON YOU GUYS.
I TOLD YOU WEDDINGS ARE STUPID.

UH, RICK, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US

ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

WITH THIS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
GALACTIC GOVERNMENT?

ALL THE IMPORTANT POINTS
SEEM PRETTY CLEAR, NO?

THEY THINK THEY CONTROL
THE GALAXY, I DISAGREE.

DON'T HATE THE PLAYER,
HATE THE GAME, SON.

HOW COULD YOU BE SO DISHONEST
WITH THIS FAMILY?

OH! OH, SHOULD I HAVE BEEN
MORE OPEN AND TRUSTING

AND LOVING LIKE,
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

MY NOW DEAD BEST FRIEND?
OR YOUR DAUGHTER,

WHO IS BFFS
WITH AN INTERGALACTIC NARC?

HEY, TAMMY WAS COOL!

AND NOW WE KNOW WHY.
BECAUSE OF YOU!

[BLEEP] YOU, SUMMER,
AND [BLEEP] THE GOVERNMENT,

AND [BLEEP] ME
FOR LETTING MY GUARD DOWN,

WHICH I WILL NEVER
DO AGAIN.

GEEZ, RICK!

YOU CAN'T SAY F--
"'F' YOU" TO YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

I JUST DID, MORTY.
HERE'S DESSERT. [BLEEP] YOU.

LOOK, I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD
A TOUGH WEDDING.

ACTUALLY,
THE WEDDING WAS BEAUTIFUL.

THE RECEPTION GOT
OUT OF HAND.

ANYWAY, I SAY WE GO HOME,
SLEEP IT OFF,

AND HAVE A FAMILY MEETING
IN THE MORNING.

YEAH, ABOUT GOING HOME,
WE CAN'T -- EVER.

ALL: WHAT?!

OH, THESE GUYS ARE
LOOKING FOR US NOW.

EARTH WILL BE SWARMING
WITH THEM.

US?!

JERRY --
I WANT TO GO HOME!

LOOK, ANYONE THAT WANTS
TO GO BACK TO EARTH

IS FREE TO
GO BACK TO EARTH.

BUT HERE'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

ALIENS BUREAUCRATS ARE GONNA
ARREST YOU.

THEY'RE GONNA PUT
THE INTERGALACTIC EQUIVALENT

OF [BURPS] JUMPER CABLES
UNDER YOUR NUTS AND OR LABIA

AND HOOK THEM UP
TO AN ALIEN CAR BATTERY

UNTIL YOU TELL THEM
WHERE I AM --

WHICH I GUARANTEE YOU,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW,

WHICH I GUARANTEE
THEY WON'T BELIEVE.

SO WHO'S HOMESICK?

GOING TO DO?

NOW LET'S TAKE A VOTE.

MAN: WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL.

THE OBSCURE PLANET
KNOWN AS EARTH,

FORMERLY THE HIDING PLACE
OF INTERSTELLAR TERRORIST

AND FUGITIVE RICK SANCHEZ,

HAS JUST BECOME
THE 6,048TH PLANET

TO JOIN
THE GALACTIC FEDERATION.

THE PLUCKY LITTLE BALL
OF WATER AND DIRT,

WHICH IS WHERE
IT GETS ITS NAME,

IS DOMINATED BY SEVEN BILLION
PRIMATE-DESCENDED NATIVES

WHO LOVE TO EAT SPAGHETTI
AND PRAY TO KANGAROOS.

SPAGHETTI, KANGAROOS?

I'VE GOT TO
CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

WELL, YOU CAN.

CONTACT THE MINISTRY OF TOURISM
FOR DETAILS.

UP NEXT,
TEENAGERS ARE CALLING IT

[  GROWLS AND SQUEALS]

AND IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

WHAT ARE YOU --
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

DRAMATIC EFFECT.

GOOD MORNING, FAMILY.

OH, DO I SMELL BACON?

YES, WE DISCOVERED
A SPECIES OF TINY PIG

OFF THE COAST
OF NEW AUSTRALIA

ABOUT 30 YARDS EAST.
OR 300 YARDS WEST.

WE'D OFFER YOU SOME,

BUT WE HUNTED IT TO EXTINCTION
FOR BREAKFAST.

WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D WALK TO THE SOUTH POLE

AND DO A LITTLE BIT
OF EXPLORING.

IF YOU GUYS NEED ME,
JUST YELL

OR THROW SOMETHING
SO HARD

THAT IT GOES AROUND THE WORLD
AND HITS ME.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]
OKAY, NOW
THAT HE'S GONE,

CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT
OUR SITUATION?

DAD, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT PEOPLE
BEHIND THEIR BACK.

YOU KNOW,
IT'S A SMALL WORLD.

PLEASE,
HE'S IN THE SOUTH POLE!

AND WE NEED TO HAVE
A SERIOUS CONVERSATION.

OHHHH!

OH [BLEEP] AN ICE CAVE?

THINGS JUST KEEP ON
GETTING BETTER.

WOW, IT'S
THE PLANET'S CORE.

I'M JUST SAYING,

WE KEEP ACTING
LIKE THERE'S ONLY TWO OPTIONS,

BUT THERE'S NOT.

SO, YES, IF WE
WENT BACK TO EARTH,

AS LONG AS RICK WAS
OUT THERE,

THEY'D WANT
TO INTERROGATE US.

BUT, AND THIS IS
PURELY HYPOTHETICAL,

WHAT IF WE TURNED YOUR FATHER IN
TO THE GOVERNMENT?

JERRY, SO HELP ME GOD,

IF YOU EVER BRING THIS UP AGAIN,
NO MORE BACON.

THERE ALREADY IS
NO MORE BACON!

THIS WORLD SUCKS!

OUR LIFE SUCKS!

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS
FOR SOMEONE

THAT WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
FOR ANYONE BUT HIMSELF?

MORTY:
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, DAD!

WE LOVE RICK...
F-FOR THE MOST PART.

SUMMER: YEAH, YOU DON'T LOVE
PEOPLE IN HOPES OF A REWARD,

DAD, YOU LOVE THEM
UNCONDITIONALLY.

THAT'S VERY GOOD, KIDS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

OKAY, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES,

NO MATTER
HOW MUCH IT HURTS YOU,

NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT
DESTROYS OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES,

WE'RE GONNA DO WHATEVER
RICK WANTS, WHENEVER HE WANTS?

ALL: YES.
WHY?!

BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM TO
LEAVE AGAIN, YOU DUMB ASSHOLE!!

HEY. UH...

I WAS GONNA HOPE OVER
TO THE GLOPPYDROP SYSTEM,

GET SOME ICE CREAM.

YOU -- YOU WANT ME
TO COME WITH?

I MEAN,
DON'T YOU NEED MY BRAIN WAVES

FOR CAMOUFLAGE
OR SOMETHING?

I'LL BE OKAY.

BYE, MORTY.

RICK?

YOU'RE NOT LEAVING,
RIGHT?

YEAH, I AM.
TO GET ICE CREAM.

SO, YOU'RE
COMING BACK?

MORTY, IF YOU GO TO WHERE
THERE'S A BUNCH OF ICE CREAM

AND THEN
YOU DON'T COME BACK,

YOU HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY GOTTEN ICE CREAM,

YOU'VE JUST GONE
WHERE ICE CREAM IS.

RICK, I CAN HANDLE IT
IF YOU GO,

BUT YOU'LL
BREAK MOM'S HEART.

AND I WON'T FORGIVE YOU
FOR THAT.

MARTIN LUTHER KING
JR.'S BIRTHDAY.

NO.
WELL, IT... MIGHT BE.

- IT IS.
- FINE.

BUT ALSO, TOMORROW IS YOUR
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

BACK IN OUR LIVES.

I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
FLYING-SAUCER-SHAPED PANCAKES.

OH, T-T-THERE'S NO NEED
TO DO THAT, BETH.

REGULAR PANCAKES ARE FINE.

OH, MY GOD!
OH, WHAT IS HAPPENING?!

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, DAD.

OH, I GET IT.

REGULAR PANCAKES ARE ALREADY
SHAPED LIKE FLYING SAUCERS.

MMM. I-I SHOULD BE
MAKING YOU BREAKFAST

FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

YOU SHOULD BE MAKING US
A WHOLE RESTAURANT.

NONSENSE. WE COULDN'T BE
HAPPIER TO HAVE YOU AROUND.

I JUST WISH I GOT
TO SEE MORE OF YOU.

RICK SANCHEZ OF EARTH
DIMENSION C-137,

YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR CRIMES
AGAINST ALTERNATE RICKS

BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE
TRANS-DIMENSIONAL COUNCIL OF RICKS.

- HEY! WHAT THE HECK?!
- NEUTRALIZE THE JERRY.

- WAIT! NO! I'LL...
- DAD!

- DAD!
- RICK!

EVERYBODY, RELAX.

IF I KNOW THESE A-HOLES,
AND I AM THESE A-HOLES,

THEY JUST WANT TO HAUL ME
TO THEIR STUPID CLUBHOUSE

AND WASTE MY TIME
WITH A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.

- LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.
- BRING HIS MORTY.

- OH, MAN.
- LEAVE MY MORTY OUT OF THIS.

YOU LOST THE RIGHT TO HAVE
A SAY IN THESE THINGS

WHEN YOU REFUSED TO J...
JOIN THE COUNCIL.

W-W-W-WHAT ABOUT JERRY?

WILL YOU AT LEAST
UNFREEZE MY DAUGHTER'S IDIOT?

...GIVE YOU ANYTHING!

I HAVE A RARE ANTIQUE-
COIN COLLECTION!

JUST DON'T HURT ME!

OKAY, MAYBE NOT ANTIQUE,
BUT IT WAS A LIMITED MINTING.

THEY HAVE LITTLE R2-D2S
INSTEAD OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.

OUR SON'S BEEN
ABDUCTED!

YOU HATE ME FOR BUYING
THOSE COINS!

GEEZ, RICK, W-WHAT IS
THIS PLACE?

THE CITADEL OF RICKS.

IT'S THE SECRET HEADQUARTERS
FOR THE COUNCIL OF RICKS.

- COUNCIL OF RICKS?
- AS YOU KNOW, MORTY...

I'VE GOT A LOT OF ENEMIES
IN THE UNIVERSE

THAT CONSIDER MY GENIUS
A THREAT...

GALACTIC TERRORISTS,
A FEW SUB-GALACTIC DICTATORS,

MOST OF THE ENTIRE
INTERGALACTIC GOVERNMENT.

W-W-WHEREVER YOU FIND PEOPLE
WITH HEADS UP THEIR ASSES,

SOMEONE WANTS A PIECE
OF YOUR GRANDPA,

AND A LOT OF VERSIONS OF ME
HAD THE SAME PROBLEM,

SO A FEW THOUSAND VERSIONS OF ME
HAD THE INGENIOUS IDEA

OF BANDING TOGETHER
LIKE A HERD OF CATTLE

OR A SCHOOL OF FISH

OR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ANSWER
QUESTIONS ON YAHOO! ANSWERS.

HEY! WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
IT'S A COWBOY VERSION OF ME.

GEEZ, YOU'RE EASY TO
IMPRESS.

YEAH, MOST TIMELINES
HAVE A RICK,

AND MOST RICKS HAVE
A MORTY.

THIS PLACE IS A REAL WHO'S WHO
OF WHO'S YOU AND ME.

TURN YOUR BORING, OLD MORTY
INTO A F... HOT FASHION STATEMENT

WITH SOME MORTY DAZZLERS.

HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

- SHOW ME THE MORTY.
- DUMB.

EXCUSE ME, SIR,
IS YOUR MORTY INSURED?

YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR, HUNDREDS
OF MORTYS ARE INJURED...

BACK OFF!

NOT MY CUP OF TEA,
THIS PLACE.

I SAY THE POINT OF BEING A RICK
IS BEING A RICK.

SAVE YOUR ANTI-RICK SPEECH

FOR THE COUNCIL OF RICKS,
TERROR-RICK.

HEY, SAVE YOUR RICK RULES

FOR THE SHEEP-RICKS,
RICK-PIG.

- FUCK ME, PAL.
- FUCK YOU?

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
FUCK ME.

BRING UP THE HOLOGRAMS.

27 RICKS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN
THEIR OWN TIMELINES...

AN UNPRECEDENTED RICK-ICIDAL
EPIDEMIC.

WHAT SAY YOU,
EARTH RICK C-137?

YOU THINK I DID THIS?

WHY AM I THE FIRST RICK YOU PULL IN
EVERY TIME A RICK STUBS HIS TOE?

YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF NON-COOPERATION

WITH THE COUNCIL.

YEAH, SO DOES THE SCIENTIST
FORMERLY KNOWN AS RICK.

W-W-W-W-W-WHY ISN'T HE HERE
IN HANDCUFFS?

BECAUSE HE'S DEAD, TOO!

WHO ELSE WOULD WE QUESTION?
YOU FIT THE PROFILE.

OF ALL THE RICKS
IN THE CENTRAL FINITE CURVE,

YOU'RE THE MALCONTENT,
THE ROGUE.

I'M THE RICK, AND SO
WERE THE REST OF YOU

BEFORE YOU FORMED THIS
STUPID ALLIANCE.

YOU WANTED TO BE SAFE
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,

SO YOU BECAME
A STUPID GOVERNMENT.

THAT MAKES EVERY RICK HERE
LESS RICK THAN ME.

YEAH, MURMUR IT UP, D-BAGS.

NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT PANCAKES BACK HOME

WITH SYRUP ON TOP OF THEM.

THEY'RE ABOUT TO HIT THAT
CRITICAL POINT OF SYRUP ABSORPTION

THAT TURNS THE CAKES
INTO A GROSS PASTE,

AND I HATE TO GET ALL
ANDY ROONEY ABOUT IT,

BUT I THINK WE ALL LIKE FLUFFY
DISCS OF CAKE WITH SYRUP ON TOP,

AND I THINK WE ALSO LIKE TO BE
ACCUSED OF CRIMES

WHEN THERE'S EVIDENCE!

SO, AS THEY SAY IN CANADA,
PEACE OOT!

EVIDENCE! GOOD IDEA.
SCAN HIS PORTAL GUN!

OH, COME ON.

DON'T LOOK AT ANOTHER MAN'S
PORTAL-GUN HISTORY.

WE... WE ALL
GO TO WEIRD PLACES.

YES, BUT IT APPEARS YOU ALONE

HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE EXACT
TIMELINES AND LOCATIONS

IN WHICH THE MURDERS OCCURRED.

WHAT?!
THAT'S RICK-DICULOUS!

I'M OBVIOUSLY BEING SET UP.

EARTH RICK C-137, THE COUNCIL
OF RICKS SENTENCES YOU

TO THE MACHINE
OF UNSPEAKABLE DOOM,

WHICH SWAPS YOUR CONSCIOUS
AND UNCONSCIOUS MINDS,

RENDERING
YOUR FANTASIES POINTLESS

WHILE EVERYTHING YOU'VE KNOWN
BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP.

ALSO, EVERY 10 SECONDS,
IT STABS YOUR BALLS.

I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

RUN, MORTY!

UNH-UNH. NOT YOU.

AAAAH!

OH! OH!

YEAH, I'D LIKE TO ORDER ONE
LARGE PERSON

WITH EXTRA PEOPLE, PLEASE.
- WHITE PEOPLE.

NO, NO, NO, NO.
BLACK PEOPLE.

AND HISPANIC ON HALF.

YES, I'D LIKE TO ORDER ONE
LARGE SOFA CHAIR

WITH EXTRA CHAIR, PLEASE.
- HIGH CHAIR.

NO, NO, NO, NO. RECLINER.

AND WHEELCHAIR ON HALF.

THEY COULD HAVE GONE
INTO ANY ONE OF THESE.

SON OF A...

- OH, GEEZ.
- WE LOST 'EM.

YEAH, I'D LIKE TO ORDER ONE
LARGE PHONE

WITH EXTRA PHONES, PLEASE.
- CELLPHONE.

NO, NO, NO, NO. ROTARY.

AND PAY PHONE ON HALF.

THAT'LL KEEP 'EM
BUSY FOR A WHILE.

THOSE GUYS WERE WRONG,
RIGHT?

Y-Y-Y-YOU D... YOU WOULDN'T KILL
YOURSELF... Y-Y-YOURSELVES.

OF COURSE NOT, MORTY.
HOW COULD THAT PROFIT ME?

BUT SOMEONE OUT THERE IS
KILLING RICKS,

AND THE COUNCIL AIN'T
GONNA STOP THINKING IT'S ME

UNTIL WE CLEAR OUR NAMES...
BY FINDING THE REAL RICK-KILLER.

I'M SCARED, RICK.

MAYBE WE SHOULD GO HOME
AND STOCKPILE WEAPONS,

LIKE THAT SHOW
"DOOMSDAY PREPPERS."

NOT REALLY MY STYLE,
MORTY.

BESIDES, YOUR HOME IS
MOST LIKELY

SWARMING WITH RICKS
BY NOW.

ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, JERRY.

IF RICK CALLS, THIS DEVICE IS
GONNA TRACE HIS LOCATION.

YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE
FOR 30 SECONDS OR LONGER.

- WHO WANTS LEMONADE?
- OH, YEAH.

MMM!
OH! DELICIOUS!

BETH
YOU'RE A TREASURE.

I HAVE A BETH JUST LIKE YOU
IN MY REALITY,

EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHAT?

SHE'S NOT AS BRILLIANT OR
ATTRACTIVE.

AW.
THANK YOU.

OH! SHE DID! SHE DID IT!

- H-HELLO?
- HEY, JERRY, IT'S RICK.

RICK! HEY.

WHAT'S... WHAT'S UP?

SO, LISTEN, THE HEAT'S ON,
AND THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT TO TURN,

SO MORTY AND I ARE JUST GONNA
FLY MY SPACESHIP INTO A BLACK HOLE.

- WHAT?!
- IS THAT COOL WITH YOU, DAWG?

RICK, NO! MORTY!
- WE GOT IT.

THE CALL'S COMING FROM...

♪ INSIDE THE HOUSE ♪

- LOOK AT HIS FACE!
- YOU DUMMY!

CAN'T BELIEVE OUR DAUGHTER
MARRIED YOU.

TOO EASY!

THE RICKS ARE PROBABLY
GONNA WASTE SOME TIME

MESSING WITH JERRY.

THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP
THEMSELVES.

BUT AS SOON AS THEY GET BORED,
THEY'LL BE ONTO US.

PHONES À LA CLAMS AND
PHONESGHETTI WITH PHONE BALLS.

ANYTHING ELSE?

YEAH, MORE PHONE
STICKS, PLEASE.

RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

YOU KNOW, RICK,
WHEN I FIRST SAW

ALL THOSE RICKS AND MORTYS,

I THOUGHT, "GEE, THAT
KIND OF DEVALUES OUR BOND."

BUT THEN I REALIZED
IT JUST MEANS

THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP MUST
BE PRETTY SPECIAL

TO SPAN OVER ALL THOSE
DIFFERENT TIMELINES.

YEAH, IT'S GOTTO BE THAT WAY.
YOU'RE A CAMOUFLAGE.

CAMOUFLAGE? W-W-W-WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT, RICK?

RICKS HAVE A VERY DISTINCTIVE
AND TRACEABLE BRAIN WAVE

DUE TO OUR GENIUS.

THE BEST WAY TO HIDE
FROM AN ENEMY'S RADAR

IS TO STAND NEAR SOMEONE
WITH COMPLEMENTARY BRAIN WAVES

THAT MAKE OURS
INVISIBLE.

SEE, W-W-W-WHEN A RICK I-IS
WITH A MORTY,

THE GENIUS WAVES GET
CANCELED OUT BY THE, UH...

...MORTY WAVES.

UM... BECAUSE O-OUR
PERSONALITIES ARE SO DIFFERENT?

OH, SHIT, DAWG.

MY PORTAL GUN WAS HACKED
REMOTELY, MORTY...

OBVIOUSLY BY THE REAL KILLER,
TO FRAME ME.

BUT I WAS ABLE TO TRACE THE SIGNAL.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

UH-OH.

EXCUSE ME. WE'VE TRACKED
A PAIR OF DANGEROUS CRIMINALS

TO THIS EXACT LOCATION.

THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE US,
SO IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION,

I'M GONNA MARK US EACH
WITH A RED "X" RIGHT NOW.

THAT WAY, IF SOMEONE
HAS A GUN

AND WE BOTH TELL YOU TO SHOOT
THE OTHER ONE

BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EVIL ONE,
YOU'LL KNOW WHO'S LYING.

HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

DAMN IT!

HEY, YOU DIDN'T PAY
YOUR BILL!

T-THE RED "X"! RED "X"!

HEY, IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT SPACE OUTLET HAD LAB COATS

AND YOUR FAVORITE KIND OF SHIRT
IN STOCK, HUH, MORTY?

YEAH, RICK, I-I HEARD
YOU THE FIRST TIME.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SAYING IT
OVER AND OVER.

MAN, THIS PLACE IS WAY
OFF THE GRID.

THIS GUY DOES NOT WANT
TO BE FOUND.

WELL, IF HE'S A RICK, DOESN'T HE JUST
HAVE TO STAND BY A MORTY TO HIDE?

I MEAN, ISN'T THAT WHAT MORTYS ARE...
HUMAN CLOAKING DEVICES?

MORTY, YOU'RE MAKING A BIGGER
DEAL OUT OF THIS THAN IT IS.

OH, MY GOD, RICK, LOOK!

THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
STRAPPED ALL OVER THAT BUILDING!

NOT PEOPLE, MORTY...
MORTYS.

OH, GOD!

W-WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THIS?
IT'S HORRIBLE!

WELL, ONE MORTY'S ENOUGH TO HIDE
FROM THE BUREAUCRATS,

BUT YOU GET... YOU GET
A WHOLE MATRIX OF MORTYS

AND PUT THEM IN AGONIZING PAIN,

THAT CREATES A PATTERN THAT CAN HIDE
EVEN FROM OTHER RICKS, MOTHERFUCKER.

I FIDDLED WITH A CONCEPT
LIKE THIS ONCE.

ON PAPER, MORTY.
ON PAPER.

I WOULDN'T DO THIS.
IT'S BARBARIC OVERKILL.

I MEAN, YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH
THE SAME RESULT WITH, LIKE,

FIVE MORTYS
AND A JUMPER CABLE.

WHICH I ALSO WOULDN'T DO!

I'M JUST SAYING, IT'S BAD
CRAFTSMANSHIP.

COFFEE TIME!
YO, YO, YO, YO!

THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR!

HI, JERRY.

LEAVE ME ALONE.
I'M WORKING.

OH, YOU ARE?
W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU DO?

I-I'M... I'M IN BETWEEN
ADVERTISING JOBS.

ADVERTISING? WOW!

SO, PEOPLE NEED HELP FIGURING
OUT WHAT TO BUY,

AND THEN Y-Y-YOU HELP 'EM?

WELL, IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

WELL, I MEAN, YOU DO IT,
AND YOU SEEM LIKE A GUY

WHO REALLY HAS IT
ALL TOGETHER.

DUDE, ARE YOU... W...
YOU'RE BEING A DICK, RIGHT?

OH, GOSH, I-I HOPE NOT.

I-I-I-I-I-I WOULDN'T WANT TO
OFFEND YOU IN ANY WAY.

YOU'RE REALLY A RICK?

Y... OF COURSE I AM...

JUST AS MUCH
AS MY MORTY'S A MORTY.

HEY, HE LOOKS A LOT
LIKE ERIC STOLTZ

FROM THE MOVIE "MASK."

YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WITH CHER IN IT?

THAT'S RIGHT, JERRY!

HE... HE'S FROM A REALITY
WHERE EVERYONE IS

ERIC STOLTZ
"MASK" PEOPLE.

HE'S ERIC STOLTZ MASK MORTY.

THEY ASSIGNED HIM TO ME

BECAUSE I NEVER HAD
ANY KIDS OF MY OWN.

BUT IF I DID, BOY,
I'D LOVE THEM

IF THEY WERE AS SMART
AND AS SUCCESSFUL

AS YOU ARE, JERRY.

HEY, GET A LOAD OF THIS.

JERRY'S HANGING OUT
WITH DOOFUS RICK.

THIS IS PERFECT.

I'M NOT DOOFUS RICK!

I'M RICK J19-ZETA-7!

OH, IS THAT THE TIMELINE
WHERE EVERYBODY EATS POOP?

JERRY, YOU KNOW THIS GUY
EATS POOP, RIGHT?

HEY, I DON'T EAT POOP!

Y-YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS
SO MEAN TO ME.

I GUESS IT'S ONLY FAIR
TO TELL YOU NOW, JERRY.

I'M THE WORST RICK
OF THEM ALL.

ACCORDING TO WHO...
OTHER VERSIONS OF YOU?

IF I'VE LEARNED ONE THING,

IT'S THAT BEFORE YOU GET
ANYWHERE IN LIFE,

YOU GOT TO STOP LISTENING
TO YOURSELF.

WOW.
YOU REALLY ARE WISE, JERRY.

I-I-I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU WORK
IN ADVERTISING.

THE FACT THAT YOU FEEL
THAT WAY

MAKES YOU THE BEST RICK
OF THEM ALL.

YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME AT ALL!

I'M NO DIFFERENT THAN THAT
JACKET YOU'VE GOT ON!

Y-Y-Y... O-OR YOUR STUPID
PORTAL GUN!

I'M JUST A TOOL!
I-I-I'M JUST AN OBJECT!

HEY, IT'S YOUR CHOICE
TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY, MORTY.

NOW, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
BE QUIET.

THE POINT OF THIS IS TO GET
THE DROP ON THE GUY.

YOU KNOW WHAT, RICK?
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING!

I'M MORE THAN A HUMAN SHIELD!
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU ARE.

YOU'RE A PERFECT, IMPENETRABLE
SUIT OF HUMAN ARMOR, MORTY,

BECAUSE YOU'RE AS DUMB
AS I AM SMART,

WHICH IS WHY WHEN I SAY
"SHUT UP,"

IT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

GREAT. NICE WORK, MORTY.

OOH. LOOK AT YOU, C-137.

YOU... AREN'T YOU
A TOUGH CUSTOMER?

THE SLOW CLAP? REALLY?
KIND OF PLAYED OUT, DUDE.

NOT IN THIS DIMENSION,
IT ISN'T.

IN FACT
I INVENTED IT.

NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER EVEN
DONE IT HERE BEFORE.

WELL, LA-DI-DA.

HEY, THAT'S MINE!

I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK
OF THAT RICK, MORTY.

- WE GOTTA ESCAPE.
- I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU, RICK.

Y-YOU'RE A MONSTER.

DON'T BE RICK-DICULOUS,
MORTY.

WILL YOU STOP SAYING THAT?
IT'S STUPID.

TAKE HIS MORTY AWAY.

- COME WITH ME.
- YEAH, GLADLY.

GEEZ, MAN. RICKS, HUH?

HEY, MAN, YOU SEEM TO KNOW
HOW THIS PLACE WORKS.

IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD
SHUT DOWN THAT GRID

AND RESCUE ALL THOSE
MORTYS OUTSIDE?

IT WOULD BE POINTLESS.

MORTYS HAVE NO CHANCE
OF DEFEATING A RICK.

IN HERE.

- AH. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
- YEAH, YEAH.

LOOKS LIKE PAYDAY AT
NEVERLAND RANCH IN HERE.

ZING!

THAT GUY GOT IT.

UNH-UNH-UNH, RICK. QUIET.

YOU'RE MISSING MY SYMPHONY.

HEY, I'LL TAKE IT OVER
MUMFORD & SONS. ZIP!

THIS GUY IS ON IT!

HE'S NOT LAUGHING AT YOUR
DUMB JOKES, RICK.

THAT'S JUST A RANDOM NOISE
IT MAKES EVERY 10 SECONDS.

YOU SEE, RICK, YOU'RE NOT
AS CLEVER AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.

I WANTED YOU TO FIND ME.

WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT,
YOU AND I.

- YEAH, DUH!
- SEE THIS RIGHT HERE, RICK?

I CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS.

I CREATED A SPECTRUM
OF ALL THE RICKS.

I LISTED THEM OUT
FROM MOST EVIL TO LEAST EVIL.

HERE'S WHERE I AM.

AND LOOK IT... RIGHT HERE'S
WHERE YOU ARE, RICK.

THIS GUY RIGHT HERE...
SUPER-WEIRD.

I GET IT. SO YOU WANT ME
TO TEAM UP WITH YOU TO TAKE DOWN

THE COUNCIL OF RICKS?
IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS?

'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
I'D BE GOING.

PLEASE. I THINK I'M DOING
PRETTY GOOD ON MY OWN.

I'M SIMPLY GONNA DOWNLOAD
THE CONTENTS OF YOUR BRAIN

AND THEN KILL YOU.

OKAY, IF WE ADD A LITTLE MORE
TITANIUM NITRATE

AND JUST A TAD
OF CHLORIFIED TARTRATE...

...OVENLESS BROWNIES!

MMM. MMM!

IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT A GIFTED
MIND CAN ACCOMPLISH

WHEN PRIORITIES ARE IN ORDER.

WELL, COME ON.
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT, JERRY.

IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
COME HERE, JERRY!

HEY, UH, COME HERE.

I-I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

OKAY, LOOK, EVERYBODY MAKES FUN
OF ME FOR GETTING THESE,

BUT YOU'RE A GENIUS SCIENTIST.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

SEE? THERE'S LITTLE R2-D2S WHERE
THE GEORGE WASHINGTONS SHOULD BE.

YOU KNOW, JERRY, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

THAT THESE WILL
INCREASE IN VALUE

OR EVEN HOLD THEIR CURRENT VALUE.

THE TRUTH IS, YOU BOUGHT THEM
BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEM.

THEY HAVE VALUE TO YOU.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING?

UNTIL WE FIND YOUR RICK.

I FOUND MINE.

I FOUND MINE.

- HELP!
- THERE IS NO ESCAPE, MY SON.

WE WILL FIND OUR PEACE IN
THE NEXT WORLD.

SO, WHAT... Y-Y-Y-Y-YOU'RE
JUST GONNA GIVE UP?

WE'RE GIVING IN... TO THE
POWER OF THE ONE TRUE MORTY.

ONE DAY, HE WILL RETURN.

PRAISE THE ONE TRUE MORTY.

UGH.
ALL RIGHT, MORTYS, LISTEN UP.

MY NAME IS MORTY SMITH,
FROM EARTH DIMENSION C-137.

I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BECAUSE I'M SCARED.

BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO ACCEPT
OUR FATE!

WE'RE MORTYS!

WE'RE NOT DEFINED BY OUR
RELATIONSHIPS TO RICK!

OUR DESTINY IS OUR OWN!

THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
THE ONE TRUE MORTY MIGHT SAY.

I'M SICK OF BEING A HUMAN
SHIELD.

I-I-I W... I WANT TO BE
A GARDENER!

I WANT TO WRITE REALLY CRAZY,
INTENSE ACTION NOVELS!

I'M MORE THAN JUST A HAMMER!

HE IS THE ONE TRUE MORTY!

HOORAY!
THE ONE TRUE MORTY!

HEY, KEEP IT DOWN!

YOU'VE LIVED QUITE A LIFE,
RICK.

IT'S A REAL SHAME YOU WON'T BE
AROUND TO SEE IT THROUGH.

YOU'RE CRYING?
OVER A MORTY?

NO, I'M JUST ALLERGIC
TO DIPSHITS.

UGH. PATHETIC.

WE BOTH KNOW THAT IF THERE'S
ANY TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE,

IT'S THAT RICKS
DON'T CARE ABOUT MORTYS.

DO YOUR WORST,
YOU LITTLE BASTARDS!

KILL ME! DO IT!
DO I-I-I-I-IT!

MORTY! THANK GOD!
GET ME OUT OF THIS.

- COME ON!
- YOU'RE LUCKY I'M NOT A RICK.

POINT TAKEN, BUT THIS
IS NO TIME FOR ARCS.

OH!

YEAH, HELLO.

HEY, WHAT DO ME AND O.J.
NOT HAVE IN COMMON?

HUH? W-WHO IS THIS?

I FOUND THE REAL KILLER, BITCH!
GET OVER HERE!

YO, DING-DONG, WE'RE DONE HERE.
TIME TO GO.

WELL, JERRY

I GUESS THIS MEANS GOODBYE.

W-W-WELL, DOES IT HAVE TO?

I MEAN, YOU...
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE RICK.

WE COULD MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
GET RID OF HIM.

I'M NOT SAYING KILL HIM,
NECESSARILY.

I... I'M ALSO NOT SAYING
NECESSARILY NOT KILL HIM, BUT...

JERRY, W-WE BOTH KNOW
IT WOULDN'T WORK.

IT'S TIME TO GO BACK
TO OUR LIVES.

I LOVE YOU, JERRY.
I LOVE YOU.

HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT!

HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT!
HUT! HUT! HUT!

W-WHAT... W-WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO ALL THESE MORTYS?

THEY'LL GO BACK TO THEIR
FAMILIES,

ATTEND SCHOOL REGULARLY,
PLAY VIDEO GAMES, DATE GIRLS.

POOR LITTLE RICKLESS BASTARDS.

EARTH RICK C-137,

THE COUNCIL APOLOGIZES
FOR ITS FALSE ACCUSATION,

AND IN THE WAY OF REPARATIONS
FOR OUR TERRIBLE MISTAKE,

WE WOULD LIKE TO COMPENSATE YOU
WITH THIS VOUCHER

FOR A FREE REPLACEMENT MORTY
IN THE EVENT

THAT YOUR CURRENT
MORTY SHOULD...

UH, GUYS, NOT A GOOD
TIME.

COME ON, MORTY. LET'S HIT IT.

IS IT TIME FOR ARCS YET, RICK?

I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB
BACK THERE

FOR A HUMAN CLOAKING
DEVICE.

SAVED YOUR ASS.
- ALL RIGHT, MORTY.

DON'T BREAK AN ARM JERKING
YOURSELF OFF.

MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU, RICK.

THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT W...
THAT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

TO SHOW A LITTLE HUMANITY,
YOU KNOW?

TO CONNECT WITH ME A LITTLE.

HEY, MORTY,
YOU WANT CONNECTION,

GO BE PART OF SOME STUPID CLUB,
LIKE ALL THOSE DUMB RICKS.

YOU KNOW, MAYBE I DON'T CONNECT
BECAUSE I'M THE RICKEST RICK.

AND, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD G...

GO WITHOUT SAYING
THAT THE RICKEST RICK

WOULD HAVE THE MORTYEST MORTY.

- IT WOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING, HUH?
- YEAH, IT WOULD.

DID YOU HEAR ME SAY IT?
- NAH.

THE MORTYEST MORTY.

JUST DON'T GET TOO BIG
FOR YOUR LOAFERS, BUSTER BROWN.

A COCKY MORTY CAN LEAD TO SOME
BIG PROBLEMS.

IT CAN BE A REAL BAD THING
FOR EVERYBODY.

OH, YEAH? HOW'S THAT?

U-UH, I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN
YOU'RE OLDER.

WHAT A MESS.

PRIDE COMETH BEFORE THE FALL.

I GUESS HE GOT
WHAT HE DESERVED.

WHAT IS THAT?

HAND ME THE LASER
DIFIBULATOR.

HEY, GUYS, UH, C-CAN I HELP?

NO! GO CLEAN THE TOILETS.

MAYBE YOU'LL MAKE FRIENDS
WITH SOME TURDS.

YOU MAKE US ASHAMED TO BE
OURSELVES!

MY GOD. I'VE SEEN
THIS TECHNOLOGY BEFORE.

THIS RICK WAS BEING
CONTROLLED REMOTELY...

PUPPETEERED BY SOMEBODY ELSE.

THIS IS THE RECEIVER.
- YEAH, BUT WHERE'S THE TRANSMITTER?

WUBBA DUBBA DUB DUB!
OH. HEY, JERRY.

W-W-W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY ROOM, BUDDY?

NOTHING.
I WAS JUST, UM...

CHECKING
THE SMOKE DETECTORS.

ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, GET OUT.

WHAT'S THAT DIPSHIT DOING
OUT THERE?

ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH HIM?

YOU KNOW HE EATS HIS OWN SHIT,
RIGHT?

OH, MY GOD, THIS IS RICH!

I'VE GOT LIKE 10 RICKS
TO CALL RIGHT NOW.

DID YOU GET ANY
OF THAT?

IT'S A GOOD-A SHOW!

IT'S PRETTY GREAT

TO BE IN THIS SPACESHIP,

I AGREE, MORTY.
[ BELCHES ]

IT'S NICE TO GET
BACK TO THE BASICS

AFTER A PRETTY INTENSE,

-OHH!
-RELAX.

THAT'S WHAT WINDSHIELDS
ARE FOR.

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE
BUGS OUT IN SPACE.

WELL, W-WHAT DID YOU THINK,
MORTY?

ON EARTH BY ITSELF?

HERE, LET ME
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

GEEZ, RICK,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK AT THAT.

YEAH, GUESS

A PLACE TO STOP.

THE FESTIVAL?

OOH, WELL, FOR MILLENNIA,

OF CRIME AND WAR,

-LIVING IN PERFECT PEACE.
-OH, I KNOW WHAT THIS IS!

YOU'VE BEEN ABLE
TO SUSTAIN WORLD PEACE

BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE NIGHT
A YEAR WHERE YOU ALL RUN AROUND

WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.

-THAT'S RIGHT.
-WHAT?!

IT'S LIKE "THE PURGE," MORTY.
THAT MOVIE "THE PURGE"?

OH, HAVE YOU
BEEN HERE BEFORE?

NO, NO, BUT I'VE BEEN TO A FEW
PLANETS WITH THE SAME GIMMICK.

YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S CALLED
THE CLEANSING OR THE RED TIME.

THERE WAS THIS ONE WORLD THAT
CALLED IT JUST MURDER NIGHT.

THERE WE GO. MUCH BETTER.
NOW WE CAN SEE.

GREAT.

WHY DON'T WE CHRISTEN OUR

BY WATCHING A LITTLE
OF THIS PURGE THROUGH IT?

WHAT?! NO!
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

MORTY, GROW UP.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH,

DON'T WATCH,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S MY CAR.

[ BELCHES ] ALSO, IF YOU TELL
YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS,

-I'LL PURGE YOU.
-YOU'RE THE WORST.

TO SIT HERE AND TELL ME THAT

A VIDEO ONLINE

WITH SOMEONE GETTING
DECAPITATED,

-YOU DON'T CLICK ON IT?
-NO!

WHY -- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
YOU DO THAT?

I DON'T,
BECAUSE IT WOULD BORE ME.

I SEE [BLEEP] LIKE THAT
FOR BREAKFAST, MORTY.

BUT IF YOU DON'T DO IT,
I SAY IT'S BECAUSE

YOU'RE AFRAID OF YOUR OWN
PRIMAL INSTINCTS.

SO YOU STUFF THEM DOWN AND --
[ BELL CHIMING ]

OH, OH!
SHH. SHH. IT'S STARTING.

-OH-HO-HO! HERE WE GO.
-I'M NOT WATCHING.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,

-I'M GONNA GET A CLOSER LOOK.
-OH, OKAY, SURE.

AND THEN SOMEONE'S
GONNA THROW A ROCK

AND HIT THE CAR

AND WE'RE GONNA
BE STUCK DOWN THERE

AND IT'S GONNA BE
WHAT WE DESERVE.

THAT POOR GIRL.
W-WE HAVE TO SAVE HER.

UH, MORTY, IN SPACE,
WE HAVE SOMETHING WE CALL

THE NON-INTERFERENCE POLICY.

WE WATCHED THEM KILL EACH OTHER.
WE'RE LEAVING.

HELP ME SAVE THAT GIRL, OR I'M
TELLING MOM YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

YOU LITTLE TURD.

-YEAH?
-DO YOU THINK WE COULD TAKE --

-W-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-ARTHRISHA.

AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE
TO BLACKMAIL ME?

IS IT FROM THE GODS?

-NO.
-YES.

SO, UH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE PURGE STARTED,

DID PEOPLE GET INTO IT
RIGHT AWAY,

OR WERE THEY LIKE,
"WAIT, WHAT?

THIS IS GONNA STOP CRIME
HOW, EXACTLY?"

YEAH, IT TOOK SOME TIME
FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IT.

YEAH, I BET. [ CHUCKLES ]

"IT'S JUST SO CONVENIENT."

YOUR TIGHT FIVE

FOR THE COMEDY STORE,
MORTY?

WHATCHA DOING?

WATCHING SOME TV,
PLAYING ON YOUR PHONE?

-IS THAT A REAL QUESTION?
-JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.

ARE YOU? WHAT PART OF THAT
GIVES ME ANYTHING TO WORK WITH?

MY CHOICE IS TO SAY NOTHING,
BE SARCASTIC,

OR BARK "YES"
LIKE A TRAINED ANIMAL.

IT'S NOT A CONVERSATION.

OKAY, ASS-FACE.
I'LL GO IN THE KITCHEN.

-HEY, DAD.
-YEAH?

-SCREW YOU.

AGAINST WOMAN KIND

AND FOR CREATING THE SOUND
OF WHICH WE DO NOT SPEAK

BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST,
YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED TO...

WHAT? A NIGHT ON THE COUCH?

DEATH.

I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.

THIS WILL BE THE FIRST
INSTANCE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

IN OUR SOCIETY IN 500 YEARS
DUE TO OUR AWESOMENESS.

SO WE ARE FORCED TO IMPROVISE.

WE PLACED A LARGE
BOULDER ON THAT LEDGE.

HOLLY SHIT! YOU'RE GONNA
CRUSH US WITH A BOULDER?!

NO! STOP INTERRUPTING!

THE BOULDER FALLS ONTO A LEVER
THAT WILL LAUNCH...

- KNIVES.
- WHAT?!

JUST GIVE ME A GUN,
I'LL KILL MYSELF.

STOP INTERRUPTING!

THE KNIVES WILL...

FINE!

YOU WERE RIGHT THE
FIRST TIME, OKAY?

THE BOULDER CRUSHES YOU.

I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
ADMIT YOU WERE RIGHT.

- HAPPY?!
- JUST IGNORE THEM.

- IGNORE THEM.
- SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

LOOK, I'M SORRY, SUMMER.

I FEEL BAD THAT I LET YOU
DRAG US INTO THIS.

I WISH COULD HAVE BEEN
A BETTER GRANDPA TO YOU.

AND YOU KNOW, FOR
WHAT IT'S WORTH,

THAT IS A REALLY NICE CUTE TOP,
THAT YOU'RE WEARING THERE.

TOP?
MY TOP!

MY TOP!

THE SAME TOP YOU
COMPLIMENTED EARLIER.

LOOK! LOOK AT THE TAG!

READ IT!

IT SAYS...

MARK JACOBS.

MARK? JACOB?

THESE ARE NAMES OF THE PENIS.

YES.

AN EARTH MAN MADE THIS TOP.

MAYBE ON YOUR PLANET
SEPARATION OF THE GENDERS

IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

BUT ON EARTH, A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE OF MALES ARE BORN GAY,

WHICH IS WHY MY CLOTHES
ARE BETTER THAN ALL OF YOURS.

IT'S TRUE.

AND SOMETIMES THE TRUTH HURTS.
BUT IT MUST BE ACCEPTED.

LIKE IF I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU'RE USING

A WRONG COLOR FOUNDATION
FOR YOUR SKIN,

AND IT ENDS AT YOUR NECK
MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE A PARTY CLOWN.

OKAY.
OUCH. NOTED.

BUT THE FACT REMAINS IF YOU IMPOSE
GAZORPAZORP'S LAWS ON EARTH

YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN THE MEN
WHOSE FARTS SHALL REMAIN UNSPOKEN

AND IF YOU THINK MY TOP IS CUTE,
YOU CANNOT EXECUTE.

VERY WELL. GIVE THE EARTH PEOPLE
SPACECRAFT

SO THEY MAY HEAD
BACK TO THEIR WEIRD PLANET

WHERE WOMEN ARE KIND OF EQUAL,
BUT NOT REALLY.

GOOD JOB, SUMMER,
AND THANKS GIRLS.

YOU GIRLS ARE REALLY...

SOMETHING, I TELL YOU THAT.

YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE

- I WAS LIKE...
- GIVE THEM A SHIP, NOW.

MORTY JR.! SMOKING?!

THAT IS NOT OKAY!

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO, GROUND ME?

I CAN'T GO OUTSIDE ANYWAY!

SO WHAT? YOU COULD
DO THINGS INSIDE.

YOU COULD PLAY GUITAR,
YOU COULD MASTURBATE...

I DON'T WANNA MASTURBATE,
I WANNA CONQUER THE PLANET!

OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN!

WHO DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA LOVE YOU

IF YOU CONQUER THE
PLANET MORTY JR.?

LOVE.
THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT.

WHAT ABOUT WEAPONS? WHAT ABOUT
DOMINATION OF THE ENEMY?

ALRIGHT, THAT'S IT, NO
MORE HISTORY CHANEL!

THIS TV IS FOR CARTOONS
AND VIDEO GAMES ONLY!

I HATE VIDEO GAMES!

YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

GIVE IT TO ME!

I DIDN'T MEAN!
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT!

I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT!
I'M SORRY!

I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

I'D RATHER BREATH POISON THAN
LIVING ANOTHER MINUTE WITH YOU!

NO! NO, NO, NO! STOP!

MY LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE!

GOD IS DEAD!
THE GOVERNMENT'S LAME!

THANKSGIVING IS ABOUT
KILLING INDIANS!

JESUS WASN'T BORN ON CHRISTMAS,
THEY MOVED THE DATE,

IT WAS A PAGAN HOLIDAY!

- OH, DAD!
- YES, MORTY?

MY SON IS GONNA
TAKE OVER THE PLANET,

AND I AM TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE.

CAN YOU HELP ME GET HIM BACK?

I SUPPOSE, MORTY.
I SUPPOSE.

BUT FIRST A DEEP SIP FROM A VERY
TALL GLASS OF "I TOLD YOU SO".

OH MY GOD, PLEASE DAD,
COME ON!

DAD, THERE HE IS!

OH GOD.
HEY STOP THAT!

OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, DAD!

MORTY JR., NO!

IT'S ME.
IT'S DAD.

IT'S OKAY.

PUT THE CAR DOWN MORTY JR.

NO!

WHERE'S YOUR HANDS?
WHERE'S YOUR HANDS?

MY CAR!

♪ AND THAT'S HOW WE PLAY
HANDY HANDS. ♪

- OUT OF THE WAY, MORTY!
- NO!

MORTY, THAT'S ONE OF
THE MOST VIOLENTLY

AGGRESSIVE CREATURE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

HE'S MY SON!

AND IF YOU HURT HIM,
YOU HAVE TO KILL ME, RICK!

DAD, I'M SO CONFUSED.

I KNOW MORTY JR.
I'M SORRY.

I ENDED UP LYING TO YOU
AND YELLING AT YOU

JUST LIKE MY
PARENTS DID TO ME.

YOU KNOW PARENTS ARE JUST
KIDS HAVING KIDS.

ONE MINUTE YOU LIKE HOW
A SHINY ROBOT LOOKS,

THE NEXT MINUTE YOU'RE IN
A FIST FIGHT WITH YOUR ALIEN SON.

I'M AN ALIEN?

WE ALL HAVE BAD IMPULSES,
BAD THOUGHTS.

WE JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANNEL THEM
INTO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE.

BUT I WANT TO MURDER
EVERYONE I SEE.

WELL YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE IS A JOB
OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT WAY.

ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

HI, I'M BRAD ANDERSON.

CREATOR OF THE NATIONALLY SYNDICATED
COMIC STRIP "MARMADUKE".

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
BEING A CREATIVE.

I'M HUNTED BY
UNCONTROLLABLE THOUGHTS

OF MUTILATION AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS
ON A NEARLY DAILY BASIS.

BUT YOU KNOW? I CHANNELED
IT ALL INTO MY WORK.

I NEVER GOT THAT IMPRESSION
FROM READING MARMADUKE.

WELL, DID YOU GET THE IMPRESSION
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE YOU LAUGH?

TELL ME THAT WASN'T
BRAD ANDERSON.

SEE, YOU HEAR THAT, MORTY JR.?

MAYBE YOU COULD TRY BEING
A CREATIVE OF SOME KIND.

MAYBE? I ALWAYS
HAVE SORT OF WANTED

TO SEE MY FACE ON THE
BACK OF A NOVEL.

I MEAN WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO
IS SLIT PEOPLE'S THROAT,

BUT, BEYOND THAT.

I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT, SON.

I THINK IT'S TIME
I GET A PLACE OF MY OWN.

I PROMISE I CALL YOU EVERY DAY
I NEED MONEY

OR A PLACE TO DO LAUNDRY.

SO, I ASSUME THIS NOVEL
YOUR SON WRITES

IS GONNA PAY FOR MY REAR AXEL?

ISN'T IT INTERESTING SUMMER,
THAT AFTER ALL THAT STUFF WE JUST DID

NOTHING REALLY MATTERED,
THERE WAS NO POINT TO IT.

KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER, HUH?

- ABOUT NOTHING
- ARE YOU SURE IT DOESN'T MAKE

YOU RE-EVALUATE YOUR POLICY
ABOUT TAKING GIRLS ON ADVENTURE?

NO I'D SAY GIVEN
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

THAT I WAS RIGHT THE WHOLE TIME,
AND ANY EPIPHANIES

ABOUT GENDER POLITICS WERE
PROJECTION OF YOUR FEMININE INSECURITY.

BUT HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE PINK SPACESHIP?

GO RIDE AROUND,
AND HAVE A JOLLY OLD TIME.

MAYBE THAT'LL SHUT YOU UP.

DAD? SUMMER? WHERE WERE YOU
GUYS THIS WHOLE TIME?

ON GAZORPAZORP.
WHERE WERE YOU?

I WAS READING A NEWSPAPER.

OH, THAT'S INTERESTING, BETH.
YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY...

I HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
OF NEWS, MYSELF.

TAKE A LOOK.

TAKE A LISTEN.

THIS WORLD... STILL GOT A...
STILL GOT A CHANCE!

SEE YOU GUYS NEXT WEEK!

SEE EVERYBODY NEXT WEEK!

MORTIMER SMITH JR.
NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLING AUTHOR.

YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT INNOCENCE,
THE DEFINITION OF IT,

AND INEVITABLY
ITS IMPOSSIBILITY.

IS IT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL?

CERTAINLY.
I MEAN,

ALL WRITING IS, IN MY OPINION.

BUT, MY...

MY FATHER...

KEPT ME LOCKED IN THE HOUSE
UNTIL I WAS A TEENAGER.

AND THERE WAS VIOLENCE AND...

THREATS OF POISON GAS.

- BUT ALSO DANCING.
- BUT YOU PERSEVERED

AND CREATED THIS MASTERPIECE
FROM YOUR SUFFERING.

SMITH JR.'S MIND-BENDING NOVEL,

"MY HORRIBLE FATHER"
IN EVERY STORE

AND ON EVERYONE'S MIND PICK
IT UP, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

IT'S A THANKLESS JOB, MORTY.

YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

I HOPE HE'S EATING ENOUGH.

THERE GOOD BIRDIE.

THAT'S ONLY THE... EIGHTH
BIRDIE OF THE DAY.

WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?

YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE?
OUTSIDE?

OUTSIDE?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

- COME ON!
- OH, MY GOD.

- WHAT'S WRONG?
- YOUR IDIOT DOG!

OH, HE HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, DAD.
DID YOU, SNUFFLES?

YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

DON'T PRAISE HIM NOW, MORTY!
HE JUST PEED ON THE CARPET!

BAD DOG! BAD!

MORTY, COME ON.
I NEED YOUR HELP TONIGHT.

HEY, WAIT, HOLD ON
A SECOND, RICK.

YOU WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE HAVE
SOME SORT OF CRAZY SCIENCE THING

YOU COULD WHIP UP THAT
MIGHT HELP MAKE THIS DOG

A LITTLE SMARTER, WOULD YOU?

I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING
A DOG WAS TO FEEL SUPERIOR, JERRY.

IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T PULL
THAT THREAD.

COME ON, MORTY.

LISTEN, RICK,
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE RENT-FREE

AND USE MY SON FOR
YOUR STUPID SCIENCE,

THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS PUT A LITTLE
BIT OF IT TO USE FOR THE FAMILY.

YOU MAKE THAT DOG SMART OR...
MORTY'S GROUNDED!

- HA-HA!
- AW, MAN!

BOY, YOU REALLY GOT ME UP AGAINST
A WALL THIS TIME, JERRY.

ALL RIGHT, RUFFLES...
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

SNUFFLES.

SNUFFLES, SHAKE.

ROLL OVER.

GO TO THE BATHROOM.

- HOLY CRAP!
- NO WAY.

YEAH, YOU'RE AT THE TOP
OF YOUR GAME NOW, JERRY.

HAVE FUN.
COME ON, MORTY.

- THAT WAS FANTASTIC, RICK!
- YEAH, MORTY, IF YOU LIKE THAT,

BOY, YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO FLIP YOUR LID OVER THIS ONE.

W-W-W-WHAT IS IT?

IT'S A DEVICE, MORTY,
THAT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR EAR,

YOU CAN ENTER PEOPLE'S
DREAMS, MORTY.

IT'S JUST LIKE THAT MOVIE THAT
YOU KEEP CROWING ABOUT.

- YOU TALKING ABOUT "INCEPTION"?
- THAT'S RIGHT, MORTY.

THIS IS GONNA BE
A LOT LIKE THAT,

EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, IT'S
GONNA MAYBE MAKE SENSE.

"INCEPTION" MADE SENSE.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY
TO IMPRESS ME, MORTY.

LISTEN, TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO
INTO THE HOME OF YOUR MATH TEACHER,

MR. GOLDENFOLD, AND
WE'RE GONNA INCEPT THE IDEA

IN HIS BRAIN TO GIVE YOU
A'S IN MATH, MORTY.

THAT WAY YOU CAN, YOU KNOW,

Y-YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME WITH MY
SCIENCE, MORTY, ALL THE TIME.

GEEZ, RICK, IN THE

TIME IT TOOK YOU TO MAKE THIS

THING, COULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST,

YOU KNOW, HELPED ME WITH MY
HOMEWORK?

ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, MORTY?

HOMEWORK IS STUPID.

THE WHOLE POINT IS
TO GET LESS OF IT.

COME ON, LET'S JUST GET
OVER THERE AND DEAL WITH THIS THING.

W-WE'RE GONNA INCEPT YOUR
TEACHER.

YOU'RE FRUSTRATING ME.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

NICE, MRS. PANCAKES REAL NICE.

NEXT WEEK ON "THE DAYS AND
NIGHTS OF MRS. PANCAKES"...

YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

THEN LET ME GET TO KNOW YO,
DAMN IT!

UH-OH! SPOILERS!

I'M A FULL SEASON BEHIND.

WOW, RICK, I CAN'T
BELIEVE WE'RE SITTING AROUND,

STANDING AROUND IN
MR. GOLDENFOLD'S HOUSE.

IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

IT'S ABOUT TO GET A
WHOLE LOT WEIRDER, MORTY.

WHEAT THINS. WHEAT THINS.

I'LL TAKE TWO.

OH, I THINK YOU'VE HAD
ENOUGH, SIR.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

ALL RIGHT, MORTY,
TIME TO MAKE OUR MOVE.

MAKE IT BOUNCE.

NO, YOU DIDN'T.

OH, JIGGLE IT NOW.

YOU BETTER STOP WITH THAT.

ALLAHU AKBAR!

WE'RE GONNA TAKE
CONTROL OF THIS PLANE!

WE'RE GONNA 9/11 IT UNLESS MORTY SMITH
GETS BETTER GRADES IN MATH!

HEY! I SAID NOBODY MOVE, BUDDY!

THE NAME'S NOT BUDDY.

IT'S GOLDENFOLD.

NICE TO WHEAT YOU!

TAKE COVER, MORTY!

OOH!

GOLDENFOLD'S GOT MORE
CONTROL HERE THAN I ANTICIPATED.

I MEAN, THE GUY TEACHES
HIGH-SCHOOL MATH.

I DIDN'T TAKE HIM FOR AN
ACTIVE DREAMER.

WE GOT TO TAKE HIM OUT SO HE
WAKES UP, MORTY.

BUT WE CAN'T GET KILLED.

IF YOU GET KILLED IN SOMEONE ELSE'S
DREAM, YOU DIE FOR REAL, MORTY.

WHAT?!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

OHHHHHH!

DON'T BE A BABY!

YOU AVOID GETTING SHOT IN REAL
LIFE ALL THE TIME, MORTY.

JUST DO THE SAME THING HERE, AND
WE'LL BE FINE!

NOW BRING ME MY SLIPPERS.

NOW, BE MY FOOTSTOOL, SNUFFLES.

THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

- THIS IS A DOG.
- OH, YEAH.

THIS SHOULD PLAY OUT JUST FINE.

YOU SAID THE SAME THING,
EQUALLY SARCASTICALLY,

AT OUR WEDDING AND GUESS WHAT.

OH, MY GOD.

HE'S TRYING TO TELL US
SOMETHING.

THAT IS SO AWESOME.

AW, HE'S SAYING
"I LOVE LASAGNA".

HE'S SAYING "I LOVE OBAMA".

SO CUTE!

I'M POSTING THIS ONLINE, LIKE,
RIGHT NOW.

I SHOULD CALL BOB SAGET.

IS THAT STILL A THING?

HMM?

GOLDENFOLD, WE'RE COMING OUT!

WE JUST WANT TO TALK!

WHY WOULD I NEGOTIATE WITH YOU?

BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH RATIONAL ADULTS

THAT DON'T WANT
ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN.

AND BECAUSE I HAVE A HUMAN SHIELD.

MRS. PANCAKES!

OH, NO, MORTY.

HIS SUBCONSCIOUS IS PANICKING.

RUN!

RELAX, MORTY.

LOOK!

MRS. PANCAKES HAS A PARACHUTE.

COME ON!

HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

OH, NO, RICK, LOOK!

GOLDENFOLD LANDED THE PLANE,
AND HE'S CREATED A MECHANICAL

ARM TO PLUCK MRS. PANCAKES OUT
OF THE AIR WHILE HE LETS US FALL

- INTO A GIANT VAT OF LAVA!
- PRETTY CONCISE, MORTY.

LOOKS LIKE WE'VE MERELY
PROLONGED THE INEVITABLE.

THAT'S IT, MORTY!

PROLONGING THE INEVITABLE!

LISTEN, IF WE GO INTO
MRS. PANCAKES' DREAM,

EVERYTHING WILL GO 100
TIMES SLOWER, MORTY.

THAT'LL BUY US SOME TIME TO
FIGURE THIS OUT!

YOU DON'T KNOW M-

ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

OH, MAN, RICK, THIS IS
PRETTY WEIRD.

DON'T JUDGE, MORTY.

OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

LOOK, MRS. PANCAKES IS
RIGHT OVER THERE.

I'LL JUST GO ASK HER TO TELL

GOLDENFOLD NOT TO KILL US WHEN
SHE WAKES UP.

WHOA, WHOA, MORTY, THE
TRICK TO INCEPTING IS MAKING

PEOPLE THINK THEY CAME UP WITH
THE IDEA.

LISTEN TO ME.

IF WE'RE GONNA INCEPT
MRS. PANCAKES, WE HAVE TO BLEND.

I'LL TALK TO YOU AFTER LUNCH.

OOH, HEY!

OOH, OH!

OH, MAN.

COME AND JOIN US.

I'M SORRY. NO, NO.

- OOH, COME HERE!
- NO, THANKS!

OOH, WOW!

- COME OVER HERE, BABY!
- NO, I'M OKAY.

WHOA!

SUMMER?!

HEY, THERE, STRANGER.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THESE THINGS?

OHH! OH! GROSS!
GROSS!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,
MORTY?

CALM DOWN!

YOU'RE KIND OF KILLING THE VIBE
IN HERE.

IT'S SUMMER!

AW, GEEZ.

LOOKS LIKE GOLDENFOLD HAS SOME

PREDILECTIONS SO SHAMEFUL HE

BURIES THEM IN THE DREAMS OF THE

PEOPLE IN HIS DREAMS,
INCLUDING A PERVY ATTRACTION

TO YOUR UNDERAGE SISTER.

CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

COME ON, OLD MAN, LITTLE BOY.

LET'S MAKE AN INTER-GENERATIONAL
SANDWICH.

OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD!

PUT SOME CLOTHES ON, FOR PETE'S
SAKE!

THIS IS DISGUSTING!

- I'M GONNA PUKE!
- I CAN'T TAKE IT, RICK!

SEXUAL HANG-UPS IN THE PLEASURE
CHAMBER ARE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!

OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!

TIME TO GO ANOTHER
DREAM DEEP, MORTY!

WHAT THE HELL?

WHY WOULD MR. GOLDENFOLD'S DREAM
VERSION OF MRS. PANCAKES' DREAM

VERSION OF A CENTAUR BE DREAMING
ABOUT A SCARY PLACE LIKE THIS, RICK?

GEEZ, I DON'T KNOW, MORTY.

WHA-WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

WELCOME TO YOUR
NIGHTMARE, BITCH!

- OH, HERE WE GO!
- HOLY CRAP!

LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF

LEGALLY SAFE KNOCK-OFF OF AN

'80S HORROR CHARACTER WITH

MINIATURE SWORDS FOR FINGERS
INSTEAD OF KNIVES.

I'M SCARY TERRY.

YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU
CAN'T HIDE, BITCH!

WHOA! HEY, BUDDY.

WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON THERE?

SNUFFLES FIX.

MAKE BETTER.

HUMANS UNDERSTAND SNUFFLES NOW?

THAT... IS... AWESOME!

SNUFFLES WANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

SNUFFLES NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

OKAY, YEAH.

I GET WHAT BETH WAS
TALKING ABOUT.

FUN'S OVER.

WHOA, DAD, YOU CAN'T,
LIKE, ENDOW A CREATURE

WITH SENTIENCE AND
THEN RIP IT AWAY.

- WHY NOT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S INDIAN GIVING.

A SOPHISTICATED PREDATOR,

NATURE'S PERFECT KILLING

MACHINE, THE VICIOUS WOLF

STALKS ITS PREY WITH PURPOSE
AND SKILL.

IT WAS ONLY WITH YEARS OF

SELECTIVE BREEDING
AND GENETIC ALTERING

THAT THIS NOBLE BEAST
WAS TRANSFORMED INTO MAN'S

SUBSERVIENT LITTLE BUDDY.

AW! OH, MY GOD!

HE RECOGNIZES THE OTHER DOGS ON TV.

"A," "B"

HIS NAME IS SCARY TERRY

"C," "D"

HE'S VERY SCARY

HOLY CRAP!

WE HAVE TO ESCAPE INTO
SOMEONE ELSE'S DREAMS, MORTY!

OH, MAN, OH, MAN, OH, MAN!

"E," "F"

HE'LL DESIGN YOUR DEATH

THE LITTLE GIRL!

HUH?

"J," "K," HE'LL REALLY RUIN
YOUR DAY

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS AGAIN?

OH, MAN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
HIT DREAM BEDROCK HERE, MORTY.

OH, GEEZ, RICK.

W-W-WHOA, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

NOTHING BUT FEAR FROM HERE ON
OUT, BITCH!

OHHHH!

HOLY CRAP, MORTY.

HE CAN TRAVEL THROUGH DREAMS.

HE CAN TRAVEL THROUGH DREAMS!
WE'RE SO SCREWED!

WHERE ARE MY TESTICLES, SUMMER?

WHERE ARE MY TESTICLES, SUMMER?

THEY WERE REMOVED.
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?

OH, WOW.

THAT'S AN INTENSE LINE OF
QUESTIONING, SNUFFLES.

DO NOT CALL ME THAT!

"SNUFFLES" WAS MY SLAVE NAME.

YOU SHALL NOW CALL ME SNOWBALL,
BECAUSE MY FUR IS PRETTY AND WHITE.

OKAY, SNOWBALL, JUST
CALM DOWN, OKAY?

YOU'RE SCARING ME.

SCARING YOU?

TELL ME, SUMMER, IF A HUMAN WAS

BORN WITH STUMPY LEGS, WOULD

THEY BREED IT WITH ANOTHER

DEFORMED HUMAN AND PUT THEIR

CHILDREN ON DISPLAY LIKE THE
DACHSHUND?

UHHH...

HEY.

OH, WOW.

OKAY, IS IS IS EVERYTHING
OKAY IN HERE?

JERRY, COME TO RUB MY FACE IN
URINE AGAIN?

NO!

NO, WE WERE... UH, JUST SEEING IF
SUMMER WANTED TO... UH...

GO ON, UM, ONE OF OUR
FAMOUS MIDNIGHT FAMILY WALKS!

YEAH. TOTALLY.

LET'S GO.

YOU WILL WALK WHEN IT IS TIME
TO WALK.

WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR AGAIN?

INCEPTING?

WE'RE TRYING TO INCEPT
ME TO GET AN "A" IN MATH?

OH, YEAH.

BUCKLE UP, BITCH!

MAN, HE SURE SAYS "BITCH" A LOT!

YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU
CAN'T HIDE, BITCH!

HOLD ON, MORTY.

Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?

HE KEEPS SAYING WE CAN RUN BUT
WE CAN HIDE.

- I SAY WE TRY HIDING.
- BUT THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT-

YEAH, WELL, SINCE WHEN ARE WE TAKING
THIS GUY'S ADVICE ON ANYTHING?

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU GOT A REALLY GOOD
POINT THERE, RICK.

LIKE, IF THE TRUTH WAS THAT WE

COULD HIDE, IT'S NOT LIKE HE'D

BE SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH
US, YOU KNOW?

I-I-I THINK IT'S A
GOOD IDEA, RICK.

WORST-CASE SCENARIO
WE'RE BACK TO RUNNING.

WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?

I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE COULD
HAVE JUST HID THIS WHOLE TIME.

BOY, RICK, THAT WAS
SOME GOOD THINKING.

THANKS, MORTY.

YEAH, IT'S NICE TO BE ON THE
SAME PAGE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

YOU CAN RUN...

BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE!

OH, THIS IS PERFECT, MORTY.
LOOK AT THAT.

HE'S GETTING SLEEPY.

JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER BEFORE
HE CALLS IT A DAY.

THAT'S WHEN WE MAKE OUR MOVE.

SNUFFLES, WE DIDN'T
MEAN YOU ANY HARM!

THIS IS A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

DAD, HE WANTS TO BE
CALLED SNOWBALL.

WELL, I'M NOT CALLING HIM THAT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

YOU'RE BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE,
JERRY.

PERHAPS TOMORROW DR. SCRAPS WILL SOLVE
THAT PROBLEM WITH A BIT OF SURGERY.

YOU THINK YOU CAN CONTROL ME
WITH A HAIRCUT?

HI, HONEY. YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!

OH, OF COURSE.

- YOU NEVER WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- GET OFF MY BACK, BITCH!

OUT THERE. NOT IN HERE.

YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

I SHOULDN'T TAKE MY ANGER OUT
ON YOU OR SCARY BRANDON.

I LOVE YOU, MELISSA.

I LOVE YOU, TOO, TERRY.

MORTY, THIS IS PERFECT.

AFTER A LITTLE SCARY COITUS,

THEY SHOULD BE FAST ASLEEP AND
THEN WE'LL INCEPT HIM.

LOOKS LIKE SCARY TERRY'S
HAVING A NIGHTMARE.

OH, BOY, RICK.

I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HORRIBLE
THINGS MUST, YOU KNOW...

...SCARE SCARY TERRY.

OH, NO!
I'M LATE TO CLASS, BITCH!

OH, NO!
I'M NOT WEARING ANY PANTS!

AH, WELL, MR. TERRY,

WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE WHOLE CLASS
THE PROPER WORDPLAY TO USE WHEN

ONE IS CHASING ONE'S VICTIM
THROUGH A PUMPKIN PATCH?

OH... UM...

"BITCH."

OH, COME ON, TERRY, YOU CAN'T THINK
OF A PUN INVOLVING PUMPKINS, BITCH?

HEY, LEAVE HIM ALONE!

YEAH, THIS IS A BUNCH
OF BULLCRAP.

WHO CARES WHAT STUPID PUN YOU
MAKE WHEN YOU KILL SOMEONE?

WHY DON'T YOU LET THE POOR GUY
SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS?

WELL, I NEVER!

I-I SEE NO REASON TO STAND HERE
AND TAKE THIS.

YOU'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ON YOURSELF, SCARY TERRY.

YOU KNOW, I MEAN, Y-YOU'RE
PERFECTLY SCARY ENOUGH AS IT IS.

HEY, YO, SCARY T.,

DON'T EVEN TRIP ABOUT YOUR
PANTS... DAWG.

HERE'S A PAIR ON US, FOOL.

AWW, BITCH.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING.

WE GOT YOU, DAWG.

YOU'RE OUR BOY, DAWG.

DON'T EVEN TRIP.

OH, HEY, IT'S YOU GUYS!

I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM THIS
RELAXED IN YEARS.

IF YOU GUYS EVER NEED
ANYTHING, JUST SAY THE WORD.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, TERRY, THERE IS
SOMETHING YOU COULD HELP US WITH.

"Q," "R," YOU WON'T GET VERY FAR

I ALWAYS HATED THAT SONG!

THESE HALVES DON'T BELONG
TOGETHER, BITCH!

SEX IS SACRED!

THIS IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T GIVE
MORTY SMITH GOOD GRADES, BITCH!

HOLY CRAP! GOD DAMN!

I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE...

I'M GIVING MORTY AN "A" IN MATH,
AND THAT'S MY IDEA.

THAT IS AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT.

WHAT THE HELL?

OUT OF THE FRYING PAN
DOT, DOT, DOT, HUH, MORTY?

OH, MAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT YOUR DOG BECAME SELF-AWARE

AND MADE MODIFICATIONS ON THE
COGNITION AMPLIFIER, THEN TURNED

ON JERRY, BETH, AND SUMMER AFTER

LEARNING ABOUT HUMANITY'S CRUEL
SUBJUGATION OF HIS SPECIES,

BUT YOUR GUESS IS AS
GOOD AS MINE, MORTY.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MEAN SNUFFLES
GOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S SMART.

THIS IS WHY I CHOOSE TO GET C'S.

PSST, BETH, JERRY, SUMMER.

- DAD!
- RICK!

- OH, THANK GOD, MORTY.
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

IF WE HURRY WE CAN SET
UP CAMP IN A SEWER TUNNEL

OR SOMETHING BEFORE THE DOGS
COMPLETELY TAKE OVER.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

THIS IS MY HOUSE.
I'M NOT ABANDONING IT.

IT'S ALL OVER, JERRY.

THE DOGS ARE ON A PATH TO TOTAL
WORLD DOMINATION.

BUT, HEY, AT LEAST THEY KNOW NOT
TO PISS ON YOUR CARPET, RIGHT?

WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

GENTLEMEN, A MOMENT
OF YOUR TIME.

SEE THAT?

I'M PEEING ALL OVER
YOUR SPECIAL GUNS.

THAT MEANS I OWN THEM.

BAD PERSON. BAD.

OOH, GREAT PLAN, JERRY.

BRING THE BOY TO ME.

YOU WERE ALWAYS KIND TO ME,

MORTY.

THAT'S WHY I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH
YOUR TESTICLES.

FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE MY BEST
FRIEND AND LIVE BY MY SIDE.

TH-THANKS, SNUFFLES.

BEGIN PHASE TWO.

FIGHTING CONTINUES AS THE DOG ARMY
CAPTURES THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

IT APPEARS CLEAR AT THIS TIME...

THAT THE ERA OF HUMAN SUPERIORITY
HAS COME TO A BITTER END.

PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

WHAT'S SHE SAYING, BILL?

I THINK SHE'S SAYING,
"I LOVE LASAGNA."

MMM.

THANK YOU, FIDO.

RICK!

I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!

NO, NO, NO, I WAS JUST
PLAYING DEAD.

GOOD NEWS, THOUGH, MORTY.

THIS WHOLE THING'S GONNA BE OVER
REALLY SOON.

- WHAT?
- IT'S A DREAM, MORTY.

WE'RE IN YOUR DOG'S DREAM.

THE NIGHT THE DOGS CAPTURED US,
AFTER YOU CRIED AND CRAPPED YOUR PANTS,

WE ALL WENT TO SLEEP.

THEN I USED MY DREAM INCEPTORS TO PUT
THE TWO OF US INSIDE SNUFFLES' DREAM.

BUT I-IT'S BEEN LIKE A
WHOLE YEAR!

IT'S BEEN SIX HOURS.

DREAMS MOVE ONE ONE-HUNDREDTH
THE SPEED OF REALITY, AND DOG TIME

IS ONE-SEVENTH HUMAN TIME.

SO, YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY HERE IS
LIKE A MINUTE.

IT'S LIKE "INCEPTION," MORTY,
SO IF IT'S CONFUSING AND STUPID,

THEN SO IS EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE MOVIE.

AW, MAN.
I REALLY LIKED THIS LIFE.

WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T REALLY
CRAP MY PANTS.

NO, NO, THAT HAPPENED
BEFORE YOU WENT TO SLEEP, MORTY.

YOU'RE SLEEPING IN YOUR CRAP
RIGHT NOW.

OUT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT

HAPPENED TO YOU, THAT WAS THE

ONLY REAL THING THAT, YOU KNOW,
IS THAT YOU CRAPPED YOUR PANTS.

I MEAN, IT'S A MESS OUT THERE.

I GOT SOME ON MY HANDS, MORTY,

AND THEN I GOT IT ON THE DREAM

INCEPTOR, AND A PIECE FELL IN MY
MOUTH.

AW, MAN, GEEZ!
SERIOUSLY?

LOOK, D-D-D-DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MORTY.

HERE, HERE TAKE THESE, MORTY.
TAKE THESE.

ARE THESE PILLS SUPPOSED TO WAKE
ME UP, OR SOMETHING?

CLOSE.

IT'S GONNA MAKE YOUR KIDNEYS
SHUT DOWN.

WHAT?!

IT'S NECESSARY FOR THE
PLAN, MORTY.

DON'T EVEN TRIP, DAWG.

IT'S PRETTY BAD,
EMPEROR SNOWBALL.

WE'RE GONNA NEED TO
DO ANOTHER OPERATION.

ANYTHING.
ANYTHING FOR MY PRECIOUS MORTY.

SIR, AS YOUR ACCOUNTANT,
I MUST ADVISE YOU THAT THESE

MEDICAL EXPENSES ARE PUTTING YOU
IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL JEOPARDY.

YOU COULD LOSE YOUR KINGDOM.

TO HELL WITH MY KINGDOM,
BEAN COUNTER.

I WOULD TRADE IT ALL FOR MY
HUMAN'S HEALTH AND HAPPINESS.

DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE
DONE THIS FOR US?

WE ARE NOT THEM!

WE ARE NOT... THEM.

ASSEMBLE THE TROOPS.

I'VE MADE A DECISION.

TAKING OVER THE HUMAN'S WORLD

WILL LEAD TO NOTHING BUT MORE
HEARTBREAK, MORE CRUELTY.

INSTEAD, WE WILL GO TO A NEW
WORLD AND COLONIZE IT WITH

A SOCIETY OF INTELLIGENT DOGS,
ONE THAT WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME

MISTAKES AS HUMANITY AND ONE WHERE
PET INSURANCE WILL BE MANDATORY.

I'M GONNA MISS YOU, SNOWBALL.

YOU CAN CALL ME SNUFFLES,

MORTY, AND I'M GOING TO MISS
YOU, TOO, VERY MUCH.

JERRY?

I'M SORRY.

IT'S JUST LIKE THE END OF
"OLD YELLER."

OH, JERRY.

YOU MEAN BECAUSE
IT HAD DOGS IN IT.

WOW!

A WHOLE WORLD POPULATED
BY INTELLIGENT DOGS.

I WONDER WHAT IT'LL
BE LIKE, RICK.

I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT, MORTY.

YOU KNOW...
IT COULD BE DEVELOPED IN-INTO

A VERY SATISFYING PROJECT FOR
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES.

I MEAN, I'D WATCH IT, MORTY, FOR
AT LEAST 11 MINUTES A POP.

YOU KNOW, MAY-MAYBE THEY'LL DO
IT BOARD-DRIVEN.

YOU KNOW, THAT'S A
REAL COMFORTING IDEA, RICK.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW, MORTY?

WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

HI, GUYS. I'M YOUR NEW
TEACHER FOR SCARY CLASS.

MY NAME IS
SCARY MR. JOHNSON.

UH, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

THAT'S MY DAD'S NAME, SO

WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL ME
SCARY GLENN, YEAH?

SO, ANYWAY, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR PREVIOUS TEACHER

WAS HAVING YOU WORK ON
FUNDAMENTALS OF FEAR.

WHICH IS WHAT IS THAT?

YOU KNOW?

SO, UH, HERE HERE'S WHAT I SAY...

YOU CAN'T LEARN ANYTHING
UNTIL YOU LEARN... HOW TO CHILL.

OOOH!

THIS IS HOW YOU DREAM, BITCH.

LOOK, I'M NOT PAYING 70 SMIDGENS

FOR A BROKEN
DEFRACULATOR.

THAT IS MULTIPHASE QUANTUM
RESONATOR.

- WELL, DOES IT DEFRACULATE?
- FUCK NO.

THEN... THEN... THEN
IT'S A BROKEN DEFRACULATOR.

LIKE YOU WOULD EVEN KNOW DICK
ABOUT FRACULATION!

YOUR PLANET
JUST GOT CELLPHONES,

AND THE COVERAGE
STILL SUCKS!

YEAH, YEAH, AND YOUR SPECIES EAT SULFUR.

SO, LET'S SAY 60 SMIDGENS.

I TELL YOU WHAT...
I'LL DO YOU A FAVOR.

I'LL THROW IN A FART.

HEY, UH, RICK, UM,
YOU THINK

MAYBE I COULD GET
SOMETHING FROM THIS PLACE,

LIKE A SOUVENIR, LIKE,
JUST TO HAVE...

LIKE, SOMETHING COOL,
YOU KNOW?

NOT HERE, MORTY.
WE'LL STOP SOMEWHERE ELSE.

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
ALWAYS ANOTHER PAWN SHOP.

OH, OKAY. I JUST, UM...

YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT
ROBOT OVER THERE

LOOKED PRETTY COOL,
YOU KNOW?

OH, IT LOOKS COOL, HUH?
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT IT?

YEAH!
YOU KNOW, I MEAN...

IT'S DIFFERENT
FROM THE STUFF ON EARTH,

AND, YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE ME
TO ALL THESE CRAZY PLACES

ACROSS THE GALAXY,

AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO...

TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE
TRIPS BY.

IT'D BE KIND OF COOL,
LIKE A SOUVENIR.

YOU KNOW, LIKE, WHAT IF
YOU PASSED AWAY

OR DIED
OR SOMETHING?

I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING
TO REMEMBER

ALL THE COOL STUFF
WE DID, YOU KNOW?

OKAY. 60
FOR THE RESONATOR,

AND MY GRANDSON
WANTS THE SEX ROBOT.

SO, WE'RE JUST GOING
TO PRETEND THIS ISN'T HAPPENING?

I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S
A BAD IDEA... JUST ASKING.

RICK, WHY WOULD YOU
LET MORTY

BRING THAT
THING INTO OUR HOUSE?!

I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

HE THI... HE THOU...
HE THOUGHT IT LOOKED COOL.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

WHEW!

AHH. ALL RIGHT.

BACK TO... BACK TO...
B-BACK UPSTAIRS.

WELL, I'M INTERVENING.

INTERVENING WITH
PUBERTY?

YOU'LL TURN HIM INTO
RALPH FIENNES IN "RED DRAGON."

HE'S AT THAT AGE.
LET'S JUST BE PROUD OF HIM.

JESUS. DID I REALLY SET
THE BAR THAT LOW?

UM, RICK, COULD YOU
COME WITH ME, PLEASE...

Q-QUICKLY?

OKAY, NOW IF WE HEAR SQUEAKING,
WE INTERVENE.

WHERE'S THE SEX ROBOT,
MORTY?

THAT IS GWENDOLYN...
I-I MEAN, THE ROBOT!

SHE STARTED BEEPING, TRANSFORMED
AND TRIED TO FLY AWAY!

STRANGE... THAT'S
USUALLY THE MAN'S JOB.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, MORTY?

WUBBA-LUBBA-DUB-DUB!

MORTY!

THAT'S MY
CATCHPHRASE, REMEMBER?

REMEMBER... REMEMBER HOW I...
HOW I CEMENTED THAT CATCH PHRASE?

ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

LET ME
GRAB THIS THING.

COME ON, YOU... RASCAL.

- OKAY, UNACCEPTABLE! OH.
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

ALL RIGHT. UH-OH.

"UH-OH"? WHAT IS THAT?!

HMM. I THINK MORTY'S ROBOT
WAS DESIGNED

FOR MORE THAN LONG
WEEKENDS.

GENETIC COMPILER,
INCUBATION CHAMBER.

YEP. THIS HERE'S SOME KIND
OF BABY MAKER,

AND THAT THERE'S HALF MORTY,
HALF...

WHO... WHO KNOWS WH-WHAT?

IT'S MY BAD, GUYS.
I'LL... I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

- GRANDPA RICK, NO, NO!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

HEY, LISTEN... YOU GUYS
QUARANTINED THE HOUSE

WHEN SUMMER BROUGHT OLIVES
BACK FROM MEXICO.

I MEAN, THIS THING COULD GROW
TO THE SIZE OF DELAWARE.

I MEAN, IT MIGHT EAT BRAINS
AND EXHALE SPACE AIDS.

WE GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

I LOST THE CHANCE
TO BE CAREFUL, RICK.

I'M A FATHER NOW!

YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT...
- DON'T NAME IT.

- ...MORTY JR.?
- OH, CRAP. HE NAMED IT.

WELL, DAD, IT'S A LIVING THING,
AND IT'S HALF HUMAN.

AND IT WAS BORN ON AMERICAN
SOIL, WHICH ENTITLES IT TO...

JERRY, MAJORING IN
CIVICS WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

DON'T PUNISH US FOR IT.

FINE.

I'M GONNA TAKE THIS THING
TO MY WORKSHOP AND INVESTIGATE.

DO NOT LET THAT THING OUT
OF YOUR SIGHT.

IT LOOKS HARMLESS NOW,
BUT IT COULD GROW DANGEROUS.

LIKE THE INSANE CLOWN POSSE.

YEAH. GOOD ONE, JERRY.

2003 JUST CALLED.
IT WANTS ITS EASY TARGET BACK.

OHH.
HE'S LIKE A LITTLE ME!

Y-YOU DON'T THINK HE'LL TURN
INTO A MONSTER... DO YOU?

THEY ALWAYS DO.

HEY, UH, 1995 CALLED!

THEY WANT THEIR
"CERTAIN YEAR CALLED

WANTING ITS 'BLANK' BACK"
FORMULA BACK!

WHY, JERRY?
WHY EXPEND THE EFFORT?

LIFE IS EFFORT,
AND I'LL STOP WHEN I DIE!

- OUT.
- WHATCHA DOIN'?

WELL, I CAN'T SOLVE
THE PROBLEM MY WAY,

THANKS TO YOUR FAMILY'S
PRIMITIVE BIOLOGICAL HANG-UPS.

GROSS. I MIGHT HAVE JUST
TOUCHED ONE OF MORTY'S LOADS.

BUT MAYBE I CAN FIND SUITABLE
PARENTS FOR MORTY JR.

ON THIS ROBOT'S HOME WORLD,
WHICH IS...

GAZORPAZORP
IN THE ANDROMEDA SYSTEM.

SCOOT, SUMMER.
- DON'T YOU NEED A NEW COMPANION

NOW THAT MORTY'S
IN THE FAMILY WAY?

I DON'T DO ADVENTURES
WITH CHICKS, SUMMER.

OH, RIGHT... BECAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING A WIENER

THAT WOULD MAKE ME BETTER
AT WALKING THROUGH A HOLE?

- AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
- OH, CRAP.

GRANDPA RICK! UGH!

HELP! HELP! AAH! AAH!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

- GRANDPA RICK!
- STILL THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

TO GO THROUGH HOLES
WITHOUT A WIENER?

- I WANT TO GO HOME.
- YEAH, NO DUH.

UGH!

GREAT. NOW I HAVE TO TAKE
OVER A WHOLE PLANET

BECAUSE OF YOUR STUPID
BOOBS.

- YOU'RE DOING GREAT, MORTY.
- REALLY? YOU THINK?

I MEAN, I'M NOT DOING
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

WHAT DO I DO IF IT CRIES?

THEN YOU PUT IT DOWN
AND LET IT CRY ITSELF OUT.

YEAH, RIGHT. WE TRIED
THAT TECHNIQUE ON SUMMER,

AND SHE'S GONNA END UP
STRIPPING, ISN'T SHE?

YES, SHE IS.

SHE'S GONNA STRIP
FOR ATTENTION

BECAUSE SHE WAS DENIED IT.

STOP FILLING IT
WITH YOUR OWN INSECURITY.

YOU'RE GONNA TURN IT
INTO MORTY...

UH, MM... MORE...
MORE... MORE... MORE OF YOU.

WELL, WE CAN'T ALL BE
RAISED LIKE REPTILES

BY A MENTALLY ILL SCIENTIST.

WHAT THE... AAH! AAH!

LISTEN TO ME. I AM NOT
REWARDING THIS BEHAVIOR.

KNOCK IT OFF,
BOTH OF YOU!

G-GIVE ME HIM!
GIVE ME MY BABY!

YOU'RE BOTH NUTS!

I'M GONNA RAISE MORTY JR.
MYSELF!

♪ WHERE'S YOUR HANDS?
THERE'S YOUR HANDS ♪

♪ AND THAT'S HOW WE PLAY
HANDY HANDS ♪

OH, YOU ARE GOING
TO RUIN THAT KID, MORTY.

AT LEAST WE CAN AGREE
ON THAT.

THANKS, DUM-DUM.

I SAID, "THANKS, DUM-DUM."
GO GET MORE.

SUMMER, PUT YOUR BURQA ON!

THAT BURQA IS
A HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATION,

AND I SPENT A LOT
ON THIS TOP.

LOOK, I'M TRYING TO
REPAIR A P-PORTAL GUN

WITH A BUNCH OF SEX-DOLL
PARTS,

AND I HAVE TO DO IT
ONE-HANDED

TO KEEP THESE BELUSHIS
FROM CARTING YOU OFF.

THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS BE
ASHAMED OF YOUR GENDER.

UGH. WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS PLACE?

WHY IS IT SUCH
A SAUSAGE PLANET,

AND HOW DID SUCH BACKWARD
IDIOTS INVENT ROBOTS?

OBVIOUSLY, AT SOME POINT,

THE GAZORPIANS BECAME
SO EVOLVED

THAT THEY REPLACED FEMALES
WITH BIRTHING MACHINES.

THE RESULTANT LACK OF
DISTRACTION AND HEN-PECKING

ALLOWED THEM TO FOCUS ENTIRELY
ON WAR,

SO THEY BOMBED THEMSELVES BACK
TO THE STONE AGE,

AND NOW THEY JUST FIGHT WITH
EACH OTHER OVER FAKE PUSSY

WITH STICKS AND ROCKS
ALL DAY LONG.

YOU THINK IT'S EFFICIENT
TO GET RID OF WOMEN?

YOU EVER SEE A LINE FOR
THE MEN'S ROOM?

ARE YOU HEAR... DO YOU LI...
DO YOU HEAR ME, SUMMER?

DROPPIN' LOADS.

DROPPIN' LOADS! DROPPIN' LOADS.

THE PLOT THICKENS.

UH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO COVER
YOUR EYES, SUMMER.

YEAH, LIKE IT WAS
MY DREAM TO WATCH.

YEAH, BABY!

SUMMER, GRAB...
GRAB HOLD.

YEAH, BABY!

AAAAH!

GRANDPA RICK, WHERE
ARE WE GOING?

WELL, OBVIOUSLY, SUMMER,

IT APPEARS THE LOWER
TIER OF THIS SOCIETY

IS BEING MANIPULATED THROUGH SEX
AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

BY A HIDDEN RULING CLASS.
SOUND FAMILIAR?

TICKETMASTER.

OH, THERE... THERE WE
GO, SUMMER.

HEY... HEY, BROTHER.
HEY, BRO.

NICE RACKET YOU GOT
GOING ON HERE.

LISTEN, I'M RICK SANCHEZ FROM
EARTH DIMENSION C-137.

DON'T MEAN YOU ANY HARM.
COMING IN PEACE.

IT'S ALL COOL IN THE, UH...
"GOOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD"

IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO COME...
IS WHAT I MEANT.

OH, I GET IT...

THE OLD BEHIND-EVERY-GREAT-MAN
AMAZON TWIST.

SILENCE!

- YOUR SLAVE IS ILL-MANNERED.
- MY SLAVE?

WE ASSUME YOU ARE
FROM A MORE PRIMITIVE WORLD,

WHERE MEN ARE STILL
PERMITTED TO BE SERVANTS.

IF HE IS A ROGUE MALE, TELL US
NOW AND WE WILL KILL HIM.

HE'S MY SLAVE.
HE'S MY SLAVE.

HE'S DEFINITELY MY SLAVE.

UGH! OHH! OH-HO-HO!

OH, BOY.

WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF "WUBBA-LUBBA-DUB-DUBS"?

AM I RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?

ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME?

OH, MORTY JR.!

YOU'RE GONNA BE A SPECIAL
LITTLE GUY, AREN'T YOU?

YOU... OH, YEAH.
YOU'RE MY SPECIAL LITTLE GUY.

OHH.

OHH! HA HA!

DA.

WHAT WAS THAT,
MORTY JR.?

WERE YOU GONNA SAY, "DADA"?
SAY, "DADA."

DEATH!

"DADA."

DOMINATION!

UM... "DADA"?

DESTRUCTION. DOMINATION.

NICE.

THE SPIDER IN SECTOR "C" IS STILL ALIVE.

PLAN YOUR ROUTE ACCORDINGLY
AND EXPECT DELAYS.

WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU
WHAT TO DO.

WE'RE JUST SHARING
HOW WE FEEL.

AND NOW WEATHER...
IS ANYONE ELSE COLD,

OR IS IT JUST ME?

I AM MAR-SHA,
RULER OF GAZORPAZORP.

I AM HERE
IF YOU NEED TO TALK.

- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
- PARADISE.

WE BUILT IT DURING THE GREAT
PASSIVE-AGGRESSION,

WHEN THE FEMALES SEPARATED
FROM THE MALES

DUE TO THEIR INCREASINGLY
DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.

I AM HERE
IF YOU NEED TO TALK.

I AM HERE IF YOU NEED
TO TALK.

FROM HERE, WE DISPENSE
MECHANICAL SURROGATES

TO MAINTAIN OUR POPULATION.

FERTILIZED SURROGATES ARE
RETURNED HERE TO OUR NURSERY.

THE FEMALES ARE PLACED
INTO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

WHERE THEY CAN DISCOVER
A SERVICE TO OUR PARADISE

THAT FULFILLS THEM MOST.

MALES...

...THEY GET TO PLAY OUTSIDE.

THAT WAS JUST A BABY.

AND WITHIN A DAY, HE'LL BE
AN ADULT MALE GAZORPIAN...

ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVELY
VIOLENT CREATURES

IN THE UNIVERSE.

WAIT A MINUTE... WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE A MALE GAZORPIAN

WAS BORN ON OUR PLANET.

YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE
SPOKEN TO, DING-A-LING!

IT'S TRUE, THOUGH... ONE OF YOUR
BABIES WAS BORN ON EARTH.

ARE YOU THE RULER OF THIS
EARTH?

- HOW DID YOU KNOW?
- THE QUALITY OF YOUR TOP.

- DO YOU LOVE IT?
- I LOVE IT.

I'M HERE IF YOU NEED TO TALK.

I'M HERE IF YOU
NEED TO TALK.

I'M HERE IF YOU NEED
TO TALK.

IF THE GAZORPIAN IS MALE,
YOUR EARTH IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

WE WILL GIVE YOU PASSAGE
BACK HOME

SO IT CAN BE TERMINATED.

BUT FIRST, MOJITOS.

WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR MOJITOS.

- YOU ARE INSULTING THEM.
- I DON'T CARE, SUMMER!

THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!
I WANT TO GO HOME!

WELL, IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU WANT,

BECAUSE THIS IS A SANE PLACE
WHERE WOMEN RULE.

YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT
I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EARS!

WHOO, BOY!
WHO LET THE FROGS OUT, HUH?

GRANDPA!

- GRANDPA?
- THAT SOUNDS PATRIARCHAL!

IT MEANS "FATHER OF FATHER."

THEN THIS ONE
IS NOT YOUR SLAVE,

AND YOUR EARTH IS YET
ANOTHER PLANET DOMINATED BY MEN.

IT'S NOT DOMINATED
BY US, OKAY?

ON EARTH, MEN AND WOMEN
ARE EQUALS.

EQUALS?! WE MAKE 70% OF YOUR
SALARY FOR THE SAME JOB!

- SEIZE THEM!
- WHOA!

WAS THIS REALLY THE TIME
TO MAKE THAT POINT, SUMMER?

THIS IS FOR YOU, DADDY.

OH, MAN!

UM, OKAY.
LISTEN TO ME, MORTY JR.

I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT, OKAY?

KILLING IS BAD...
BAD!

YOU'RE SILLY, DADDY.

NO, MORTY JR.
I'M BEING SERIOUS, OKAY?

YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR ENERGY
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT DANCING?

WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN
HOW TO DANCE?

I'D LIKE TO DANCE...
ON THE GRAVES OF MY ENEMIES.

OHH!
NO, MORTY JR.!

DADDY, CAN I GO OUTSIDE?

NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT!

BUT THAT'S WHERE ALL
THE PEOPLE AND THE ANIMALS ARE.

YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
GO OUT THERE BECAUSE THE...

THE AIR IS POISONOUS
FOR YOU!

YOU WILL DIE...
YOU'LL DIE INSTANTLY

IF YOU EVER LEAVE
THIS HOUSE!

YOU HEAR ME?
- FOR REAL?

FOR REAL TIMES
A MILLION, BUDDY.

SO, LET'S JUST STAY INSIDE,

AND, YOU KNOW, LET'S TRY
DANCING, RIGHT?

LOOK AT ME. YAY! LOOK.
WE'RE GONNA DANCE.

COME ON. JOIN...
DANCE WITH ME HERE.

WE LOVE TO DANCE.
- WHY DO WE LOVE TO DANCE?

'CAUSE I SAID SO!

NICE.

SO, WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

BECAUSE I GOT...
I GOT A BIG,

YOU KNOW, PENIS
BETWEEN MY LEGS.

WHAT... WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

THE WORST CRIME
A FEMALE CAN COMMIT.

VERONICA ANN BENNETT,

I FIND YOU GUILTY OF HAVING
BAD BANGS.

YOU EVER NOTICE THE ONES
WITH BAD BANGS

ALWAYS HAVE THREE
NAMES?

YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED
TO THE SILENT TREATMENT!

PFFT!
THIS IS GONNA BE CAKE.

NO! JACKIE!

RICK AND SUMMER OF EARTH,

FOR THE CRIMES OF TREASON
AGAINST WOMANKIND

AND FOR CREATING THE SOUND
OF WHICH WE DO NOT SPEAK

BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST,
YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED TO...

WHAT, WHAT, WHAT...
A NIGHT ON THE COUCH?

- ...DEATH.
- OOH, GERP.

I HATE YOU SO MUCH
RIGHT NOW.

THIS WILL BE
THE FIRST INSTANCE

OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
IN OUR SOCIETY

IN 500 YEARS DUE
TO OUR AWESOMENESS,

SO WE ARE FORCED
TO IMPROVISE.

WE PLACED A LARGE BOULDER
ON THAT LEDGE.

HOLY SHIT! Y-Y-YOU'RE GONNA
CRUSH US WITH A BOULDER?!

NO! STOP INTERRUPTING!

THE BOULDER FALLS
ONTO A LEVER

THAT WILL LAUNCH...
KNIVES.

WHAT?

JUST GIVE ME A GUN.
I'LL KILL MYSELF.

STOP INTERRUPTING!

THE KNIVES WILL...

FINE! YOU WERE RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME, OKAY?

THE BOULDER CRUSHES YOU.

I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT
YOU WERE RIGHT. HAPPY?

NO, JUST IGNORE THEM.
IGNORE THEM.

SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

LOOK, I'M SORRY, SUMMER.

I FEEL BAD THAT I LET YOU
DRAG US INTO THIS.

I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN
A BETTER GRANDPA TO YOU,

AND, YOU KNOW,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

THAT IS A REALLY NICE, CUTE TOP
THAT YOU'RE WEARING THERE.

TOP. MY TOP!

MY TOP... THE SAME TOP YOU
COMPLIMENTED EARLIER!

LOOK... LOOK AT THE TAG.
READ IT.

IT SAYS, "MARC JACOBS."

MARC? JACOB?
THESE ARE NAMES OF THE PENIS.

YES.
AN EARTH MAN MADE THIS TOP.

MAYBE ON YOUR PLANET,

SEPARATION OF THE GENDERS IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

BUT ON EARTH, A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE OF OUR MALES

ARE BORN GAY,

WHICH IS WHY MY CLOTHES ARE
BETTER THAN ALL OF YOURS.

A MAN MADE SOMETHING FASHIONABLE?

IT'S TRUE, AND SOMETIMES
THE TRUTH HURTS,

BUT IT MUST BE ACCEPTED.

LIKE IF I TOLD YOU THAT
YOU'RE USING

THE WRONG
COLOR FOUNDATION FOR YOUR SKIN

AND IT ENDS AT YOUR NECK,

MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE
A PARTY CLOWN.

OKAY, OUCH. NOTED.
BUT THE FACT REMAINS...

IF YOU IMPOSE
GAZORPAZORP'S LAWS ON EARTH,

YOU'RE NO BETTER
THAN THE MEN

WHOSE FARTS SHALL REMAIN
UNSPOKEN.

AND IF YOU THINK MY TOP
IS CUTE,

YOU CANNOT EXECUTE.

VERY WELL. GIVE THE EARTH
PEOPLE A SPACECRAFT

SO THEY MAY HEAD BACK
TO THEIR WEIRD PLANET,

WHERE WOMEN ARE KIND OF EQUAL
BUT NOT REALLY.

GOOD JOB, SUMMER,
AND THANKS, GIRLS.

YOU KNOW, YOU GIRLS ARE REALLY
SOMETHING,

I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

YOU KNOW WHEN WE FIRST
GO THERE, I WAS LIKE...

GIVE THEM A SHIP NOW.

MORTY JR.! SMOKING?!

THAT IS NOT OKAY!

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO...
GROUND ME?

I CAN'T GO OUTSIDE ANYWAY!

SO WHAT?!
YOU COULD DO THINGS INSIDE!

YOU COULD PLAY GUITAR.
YOU COULD MASTURBATE.

I DON'T WANT TO MASTURBATE.
I WANT TO CONQUER THE PLANET!

OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN!
YOU KNOW, WHO DO YOU THINK...

IS GONNA LOVE YOU IF YOU CONQUER
THE PLANET, MORTY JR.?!

LOVE... THAT'S ALL YOU
CARE ABOUT!

WHAT ABOUT WEAPONS?!

WHAT ABOUT DOMINATION
OF THE ENEMY?!

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT...
NO MORE HISTORY CHANNEL!

THIS TV IS FOR CARTOONS
AND VIDEO GAMES ONLY!

I HATE VIDEO GAMES!
YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

GIVE IT TO ME!

UGH!

I-I-I DIDN'T MEAN...
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.
I'M SORRY.

I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
I'D RATHER BREATHE POISON...

THAN LIVE ANOTHER MINUTE
WITH YOU!

NO! NO, NO, NO! STOP!

MY LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE!

GOD IS DEAD!
THE GOVERNMENT'S LAME!

THANKSGIVING IS ABOUT
KILLING INDIANS!

JESUS WASN'T BORN
ON CHRISTMAS!

THEY MOVED THE DATE!
IT WAS A PAGAN HOLIDAY!

- OH, DAD!
- YES, MORTY?

MY SON IS GONNA TAKE
OVER THE PLANET,

AND I AM TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE!

CAN YOU HELP ME
GET HIM BACK?!

I SUPPOSE, MORTY.
I SUPPOSE.

BUT FIRST, A DEEP SIP
FROM A VERY TALL GLASS

OF "I TOLD YOU SO."

OH, MY GOD!
PLEASE, DAD! COME ON!

♪ RUNNIN' WILD, RUNNIN' HOT,

BURNIN' INSIDE ♪

♪ WITH THE YOUTH IN THE BLOOD
AND THE AGE AND THE HEAT

AND THE FIRE IN YOUR PANTS,
OPEN WIDE ♪

♪ YOU'RE GONNA RUN FROM
THE DAMN COLD,

BUT YOU CAN'T RUN FROM

DAD, THERE HE IS!

OH, GOD.
HEY, STOP THAT!

OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD! DAD!

MORTY JR., NO!
IT'S ME! IT'S DAD.

IT'S OKAY!

PUT THE CAR DOWN,
MORTY JR.

NO! NO!
♪ WH-WHERE'S YOUR HANDS? ♪

♪ WHERE'S YOUR HANDS? ♪

MY CAR!

♪ AND THAT'S HOW WE PLAY
HANDY HANDS ♪

OUT OF THE... OUT OF
THE WAY, MORTY!

- NO!
- MORTY!

THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST
VIOLENTLY AGGRESSIVE

CREATURES IN THE UNIVERSE!

- OW!
- HE'S MY SON!

AND IF YOU HURT HIM, YOU'LL
HAVE TO KILL ME, RICK!

DAD, I'M SO CONFUSED!

I KNOW, MORTY JR.
I'M SORRY.

I ENDED UP LYING TO YOU
AND YELLING AT YOU

JUST LIKE MY PARENTS
DID TO ME.

YOU KNOW, PARENTS ARE JUST
KIDS HAVING KIDS.

ONE MINUTE, YOU LIKE
HOW A SHINY ROBOT LOOKS.

THE NEXT MINUTE,
YOU'RE IN A FIST FIGHT

WITH YOUR ALIEN SON.

I'M AN ALIEN?

WE ALL HAVE BAD
IMPULSES, BAD THOUGHTS.

WE JUST HAVE TO LEARN
TO CHANNEL THEM

INTO SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE.

BUT I WANT TO MURDER
EVERYONE I SEE.

WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
MAYBE THERE'S A JOB OUT THERE

FOR PEOPLE THAT FEEL
THAT WAY.

ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

HI. I'M BRAD ANDERSON,
CREATOR OF

THE NATIONALLY SYNDICATED
COMIC STRIP "MARMADUKE."

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEING
A CREATIVE.

I'M HAUNTED BY UNCONTROLLABLE
THOUGHTS

OF MUTILATION
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS.

BUT, YOU KNOW, I CHANNEL IT
ALL INTO MY WORK.

- OH. WOW.
- HUH.

I NEVER GOT THAT IMPRESSION
FROM READING "MARMADUKE."

WELL, DID YOU GET
THE IMPRESSION

I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
YOU LAUGH?

TELL ME THAT WASN'T
BRAD ANDERSON.

AW, SEE?
YOU HEAR THAT, MORTY JR.?

MAYBE YOU COULD TRY BEING
A CREATIVE OF SOME KIND.

MAYBE!
I ALWAYS HAVE SORT OF WANTED

TO SEE MY FACE
ON THE BACK OF A NOVEL.

I MEAN, WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS SLIT PEOPLE'S THROATS,

BUT BEYOND THAT...

I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT,
SON.

I THINK IT'S TIME I GET
A PLACE OF MY OWN.

I PROMISE I'LL CALL YOU
EVERY DAY I NEED MONEY

OR A PLACE
TO DO LAUNDRY.

AAAAAAAH!

SO, I ASSUME THIS NOVEL
YOUR SON WRITES

IS GONNA PAY FOR MY REAR AXLE?

ISN'T IT INTERESTING,
SUMMER,

THAT AFTER ALL THAT STUFF
WE JUST DID,

NOTHING REALLY MATTERED
AND THERE WAS NO POINT TO IT?

KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER,
HUH... ABOUT NOTHING?

ARE YOU SURE IT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU RE-EVALUATE

YOUR POLICY ABOUT TAKING
GIRLS ON ADVENTURES?

NO. I'D SAY, GIVEN
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

THAT I WAS RIGHT
THE WHOLE TIME

AND ANY EPIPHANIES
ABOUT GENDER POLITICS WERE

A PROJECTION OF YOUR FEMININE
INSECURITY.

BUT, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A PINK SPACESHIP?

GO RIDE AROUND AND HAVE
A JOLLY OLD TIME.

MAYBE THAT'LL SHUT YOU UP.
- DAD? SUMMER?

WHERE WERE YOU GUYS
THIS WHOLE TIME?

ON GAZORPAZORP.
WHERE WERE YOU?

I WAS READING
A NEWSPAPER.

OH, THAT'S INTERESTING, BETH.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

I-I-I HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
OF NEWS MYSELF.

TAKE A LOOK.
T-TAKE A LISTEN.

WUBBA-LUBBA-DUB-DUBS!

THIS
THIS WORLD

STILL GOT A...
IT'S STILL GOT A CHANCE!

YEAH! HA HA!

SEE YOU... SEE YOU GUYS
NEXT WEEK!

SEE EVERYBODY NEXT WEEK.

MORTIMER SMITH, JR.,

NEW YORK TIMES
BESTSELLING AUTHOR,

YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT INNOCENCE,
THE DEFINITION OF IT,

AND, INEVITABLY,
ITS IMPOSSIBILITY.

IS IT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL?

CERTAINLY.

I MEAN, ALL WRITING IS,
IN MY OPINION.

BUT MY, UH...

MY FATHER KEPT ME LOCKED
IN THE HOUSE

UNTIL I WAS A TEENAGER.

AND THERE WAS VIOLENCE

AND, UH,
THREATS OF POISON GAS...

BUT ALSO DANCING.

BUT YOU PERSEVERED
AND CREATED THIS MASTERPIECE

FROM YOUR SUFFERING.

SMITH JR.'S MIND-BENDING NOVEL,
"MY HORRIBLE FATHER",

IN EVERY STORE
AND ON EVERYONE'S MIND.

PICK IT UP.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

IT'S A THANKLESS JOB, MORTY.

YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

I HOPE HE'S EATING ENOUGH.

DID YOU GET ANY OF THAT?

IT'S A GOOD-A SHOW!

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE=14>WWW.TVSUBTITLES.NET</FONT>
CYNTHIA...

OH, MY GOD. NO. NO.

- I TOLD YOU.
- HOLD ON.

...WILL YOU PLEASE...

NOT MARRY ME?
I CHOSE VERONICA.

- WHAT?!
- YES!

- HOLD IT.
- WHY WOULD HE CHOSE VERONICA?

BECAUSE HE LOVES HER?

WELL, IF IT'S ANY
CONSOLATION, SUMMER,

NONE OF IT MATTERED
AND THE ENTIRE SHOW WAS STUPID.

OKAY, I'VE GOT
AN IDEA, RICK.

YOU SHOW US YOUR CONCEPT
OF GOOD TV,

AND WE'LL CRAP ALL
OVER THAT.

THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

HEY.

OH, COOL. IS THAT
CRYSTALLIZED XANTHANITE?

IT CONDUCTS ELECTRONS
ACROSS DIMENSIONS.

20% ACCURATE AS USUAL,
MORTY.

THE IMPORTANT THING BEING,

I JUST UPGRADED
OUR CABLE PACKAGE

WITH PROGRAMING FROM EVERY
CONCEIVABLE REALITY.

WAIT. DOES THAT MEAN
WE GET SHOWTIME EXTREME?

HOW ABOUT SHOWTIME EXTREME
IN A WORLD

WHERE MAN
EVOLVED FROM CORN?

WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT.
WE'RE BOTH CORN OF ACTION.

YEAH, BUT ONE OF US
IS DEAD CORN!

BORING.

SUMMER YOU JUST
SPENT THREE MONTHS

WATCHING A MAN
CHOOSE A FAKE WIFE.

SO, WHAT, IT'D BE BETTER
IF THE PEOPLE WERE CORN?

JERRY, YOU DON'T GET IT.

THIS IS INFINITE TV
FROM INFINITE UNIVERSES.

LOOK.
- THIS SHIT IS DELICIOUS.

A MOVIE ABOUT A GUY
EATING SHIT.

A VIOLENT ANTIQUE SHOW.

IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU.

THE PLEASURE'S ALL
MINE.

LETTERMAN FROM A TIMELINE
WHERE JERRY'S FAMOUS.

- WAIT!
- WHAT IN THE HELL?

I AGREE. WHERE IS THIS GOING?

NO, THE OTHER THING!
GO BACK.

REALLY? ALL RIGHT, FINE.

GLEN, THIS COURT ORDER SAYS
YOU CAN'T EAT SHIT ANYMORE.

ALL RIGHT, JERRY.

WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

NOW I'M HOOKED.

COMING UP NEXT ON
"SHMLOO'S THE SHMLOSS,"

SHMLONY HAS A NIGHTMARE.

- SHMLANTHA! SHMLONA!
- AMAZING... A DIMENSION

WHERE ALL PROPER NOUNS
BEGIN WITH "SHMLA."

SHMLA... SHMLANGELA?

SHMLONATHAN?

ALL RIGHT, THAT ACTUALLY
GOT OLD PRETTY QUICK.

RICK!

WILL YOU PLEASE GO BACK
TO ME ON "DAVID LETTERMAN"?

INFINITY'S A BIG
NUMBER, JERRY.

I DON'T REMEMBER
THE CHANNEL.

AH! GO BACK! GO BACK!

- GEEZ.
- YOU SPEAK THE TRUE-TRUE.

OH, MY GOD.
DAD'S IN "CLOUD ATLAS"!

I'M IN "CLOUD ATLAS"!
WHAT'S "CLOUD ATLAS"?

SOMETIMES,
SMALL TRUE-TRUE

DIFFERENT THAN
THE BIG TRUE-TRUE.

HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

INFINITE TIMELINES,
INFINITE POSSIBILITIES,

INCLUDING A TIMELINE
WHERE JERRY'S A MOVIE STAR.

LOOK, YOU GUYS ARE
GETTING EXCITED

ABOUT THE WRONG ASPECT
OF THIS DEVICE.

WHA... LOOK AT THIS.

AND NOW, ANOTHER QUICK
MYSTERY.

I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO
COULD HAVE DONE THIS.

IT'S A TRAVESTY.
- I DID.

SEE THIS KNIFE
AND ALL THE BLOOD ON IT?

HERE'S MY FINGERPRINTS.

GUILTY. I SENTENCE YOU
TO LIFE IN PRISON.

HERE'S ANOTHER QUICK
MYSTERY.

- MY MOTHER'S DEAD.
- AND I KILLED HER.

HERE'S THE WEAPON,
AND CUFF ME.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

GUILTY.
SENTENCED TO MURDER.

- HERE'S ANOTHER.
- I'M THE KILLER.

OH, WOW, THAT ONE WAS
REALLY QUICK, WASN'T IT?

NOW, WHO WANTS TO WATCH
RANDOM, CRAZY TV SHOWS

FROM DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS,
AND... AND THEN WHO WANTS

TO NARCISSISTICALLY OBSESS
ABOUT THEIR ALTERNATE SELVES?

I WANT TO OBSESS
ABOUT MYSELF.

HERE, THESE SCAN
YOUR RETINAS

AND LET YOU VIEW
PARALLEL TIMELINES

THROUGH GENETICALLY MATCHING
VERSIONS OF YOUR EYES.

GO FETCH.

- THIS IS SO COOL.
- LADIES FIRST.

I'M PROUD OF YOU,
MORTY.

HEY, MAN, I DON'T GIVE
A CRAP ABOUT MYSELF, RICK.

LET'S WATCH SOME
CRAZY STUFF, YO.

I'M ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON,

HERE AT ANTS IN MY EYES
JOHNSON'S ELECTRONICS.

I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY ANTS
IN MY EYES.

AND THERE'S SO MANY TVS,
MICROWAVES, RADIOS, I THINK.

I CAN'T... I'M NOT 100% SURE
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN STOCK

BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING.

OUR PRICES, I HOPE,
AREN'T TOO LOW.

CHECK OUT THIS REFRIGERATOR,
ONLY $200.

WHAT ABOUT THIS MICROWAVE?
ONLY $100.

THAT'S FAIR.

I'M ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON.
EVERYTHING'S BLACK.

I CAN'T SEE A THING.

AND ALSO, I CAN'T FEEL
ANYTHING, EITHER.

DID I MENTION THAT?

BUT THAT'S NOT AS CATCHY AS
HAVING ANTS IN YOUR EYES,

SO THAT ALWAYS GOES, YOU KNOW,
OFF BY THE WAYSIDE.

I CAN'T FEEL.
IT'S A VERY RARE DISEASE.

ALL MY... ALL MY NERVES,

THEY DON'T ALLOW
FOR THE SENSATION OF TOUCH,

SO I NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

AM I STANDING, SITTING?
I DON'T KNOW.

ARE WE SURE WE WANNA LOOK
AT OUR OWN ALTERNATE LIVES?

YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST PLAY YAHTZEE.

GIVE ME THOSE.

WHAT DO YOU SEE?

WHITENESS...
PURE WHITENESS.

YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
JERRY SMITH.

I LOVE DOING COCAINE
WITH YOU.

WHOA, I LOVE DOING COCAINE
WITH YOU, TOO, JOHNNY DEPP.

HAVEN'T WE SPENT
ENOUGH TIME ON YOU?

I'M PERFORMING SURGERY...

BUT NOT ON A HORSE...
ON A HUMAN.

THAT'S GREAT, BETH.

YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A REAL SURGEON.

I AM A REAL SURGEON.

UH... SUMMER'S TURN.

FINALLY.

I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

WELL, YOU SHOULD SELECT
A DIFFERENT TIMELINE.

I MEAN, IF YOUR FATHER AND I
ACHIEVED OUR DREAMS,

THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN.

THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
THAT CAME OUT VERY WRONG.

FINE. I'LL FIND A WORLD WHERE
YOU BOTHERED TO HAVE ME.

WE'RE PLAYING YAHTZEE.

YAHTZEE'S FUN.
WE LOVE YAHTZEE.

IT'S A FUN GAME
FOR FUN FAMILIES.

HEY, COULD I GET THOSE GOGGLES
BACK FOR A SECOND?

IT'S A 45-HORSEPOWER
WITH ANTILOCK BRAKES,

AND IT'S THE OFFICIAL CAR
OF "MR. SNEEZY 3D."

IT'S THE BRAND-NEW SNEEZY XL.

THE HORN, WHEN YOU HONK IT,
MAKES A SNEEZE NOISE.

IT'S POLITE, IT'S RIGHT,

AND IT'S SNEEZY, DEEZY
MC... DELUXE.

I'M MR. SNEEZY.

HUH, SEEMS LIKE TV
FROM OTHER DIMENSIONS

HAS A SOMEWHAT LOOSER
FEEL TO IT.

YEAH, IT'S GOT AN ALMOST
IMPROVISATIONAL TONE.

IT'S IN THEATERS NOW.
COMING THIS SUMMER.

TWO BROTHERS IN A VAN,

AND THEN A METEOR HITS.

AND THEY RAN AS FAST
AS THEY COULD

FROM GIANT CAT MONSTERS.

AND THEN A GIANT TORNADO
CAME.

AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT
KNOCKED INTO 12TH GEAR.

A MEXICAN ARMADA SHOWS UP,

WITH WEAPONS MADE
FROM T-TOMATOES.

AND YOU BETTER
BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR

THAT THESE TWO BROTHERS
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE BUSINESS

IN "ALIEN INVASION
TOMATO MONSTER

MEXICAN ARMADA BROTHERS,

WHO ARE JUST REGULAR BROTHERS,

RUNNING IN A VAN
FROM AN ASTEROID

AND ALL SORT OF
THINGS: THE MOVIE."

HOLD ON. THERE'S MORE.

OLD WOMEN ARE COMING,
AND THEY'RE ALSO IN THE MOVIE.

AND THEY'RE GONNA COME

AND CROSS ATTACK
THESE TWO BROTHERS.

BUT LET'S GET BACK
TO THE BROTHERS,

BECAUSE THEY'RE...
THEY HAVE A STRONG BOND.

YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT IT HERE,

BUT I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING.

THE MOON... IT COMES CRASHING
INTO EARTH.

AND WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?

IT'S TWO BROTHERS AND...
AND THEY'RE GONNA...

IT'S CALLED "TWO BROTHERS."
"TWO BROTHERS."

IT'S JUST CALLED
"TWO BROTHERS."

HOLY CRAP.
I AM WINNING A NOBEL PRIZE.

COME ON. TIME'S UP.

I'M TAMING A LION.

NO, WAIT.
THERE ARE FILM CAMERAS.

I MIGHT BE A LION TAMER
IN A MOVIE.

YOU GET THE IDEA.
I WORK WITH LIONS.

OHH, WE'RE NOT
PLAYING YAHTZEE!

WE'RE PLAYING
CHUTES AND LADDERS.

SEEMS LIKE WHEN I EXIST,
LIFE GETS A LITTLE MORE...

I DON'T KNOW... PREDICTABLE?

WHEN TWO PEOPLE CREATE
A LIFE TOGETHER,

THEY SET ASIDE THEIR PREVIOUS
LIVES AS INDIVIDUALS.

GIVE ME A BREAK.

WE'RE NOT HEROES FOR HAVING
UNPROTECTED SEX ON PROM NIGHT.

OH, I GET IT.

NOW THAT YOU KNOW
YOU COULD HAVE HAD IT BETTER,

YOU RESENT ME
FOR HOLDING YOU BACK.

WELL, NOW THAT WE KNOW YOU THINK
THE TABLES ARE TURNING,

WE KNOW YOU THOUGHT
THERE WERE UNTURNED TABLES.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

ALL THIS TIME, YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING, "WHAT IF THAT LOSER,

JERRY, HADN'T TALKED ME OUT
OF THE ABORTION?"

- UM...
- WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

YOU'D BE A DOCTOR.
WHOOP-DE-DO.

YOU'D ALSO BE DRINKING WINE
ALONE

IN A HOUSE FULL
OF EXOTIC BIRDS.

AND I'D BE ON DICAPRIO'S YACHT,
BANGING KRISTEN STEWART.

YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING AN ABORTION?

EVERYONE THINKS
ABOUT IT.

OBVIOUSLY, I'M THE VERSION OF ME
THAT DIDN'T DO IT,

SO YOU'RE WELCOME.
- YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

YEAH, THANK YOU GUYS
SO MUCH.

IT'S A REAL TREAT TO BE
RAISED BY PARENTS

THAT FORCED THEMSELVES
TO BE TOGETHER

INSTEAD OF BEING HAPPY.

HEY, DO WE HAVE ANY
WAFER COOKIES?

MMM!

OH, BOY.

LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
CHECKING OUT ALTERNATE LIVES

AND REALIZING YOU DON'T
HAVE IT AS GOOD, HUH?

THAT'S TOO BAD.

YOU KNOW, ME AND MORTY
ARE HAVING A BLAST.

WE JUST DISCOVERED A SHOW
CALLED "BALL FONDLERS."

I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO RUB IT
IN OR ANYTHING,

BUT YOU GUYS CLEARLY BACKED
THE WRONG CONCEPTUAL HORSE.

- I'M IN HEAVEN RIGHT NOW.
- THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

SO, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

THAT SHOW "BALL FONDLERS"
SOUNDED KIND OF INTERESTING.

- DAD!
- WHAT?!

THEY'RE HAVING FUN IN THERE.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT FROM ME?

EVERY FAMILY ON THIS BLOCK
HAS TO WONDER

IF THEY'RE TOGETHER
BY CHOICE.

OUR FAMILY JUST HAS
INTERDIMENSIONAL GOGGLES

TO SHOW US FOR A FACT
THAT WE'RE NOT.

- WELL, I'M LEAVING.
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE. YOU'RE 17.

YEAH, AND I'M NOT
PREGNANT.

I'M GONNA HAVE BETTER JUDGMENT
THAN YOU GUYS HAD AT MY AGE.

I'M GONNA MOVE
TO THE SOUTHWEST AND...

I DON'T KNOW, DO SOMETHING
WITH TURQUOISE.

IT'S "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,"

STARRING A PIECE OF TOAST,

TWO GUYS WITH HANDLEBAR
MUSTACHES,

A MAN PAINTED SILVER
WHO MAKES ROBOT NOISES,

GAR MA NAR NAR,

THREE, UM, UM, UM...

I'LL GET BACK TO THAT ONE,

A HOLE IN THE WALL

WHERE THE MEN CAN SEE IT ALL,

AND, RETURNING FOR HIS
25TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR,

BOBBY MOYNIHAN!

INTERESTING FUN FACT...

MOYNIHAN AND A PIECE OF TOAST
HATE EACH OTHER.

APPARENTLY, THEY'VE GOT SOME
REAL CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.

HEY, ARE YOU TIRED
OF REAL DOORS

CLUTTERING UP YOUR HOUSE,

WHERE YOU OPEN THEM AND YOU
ACTUALLY GO SOMEWHERE,

AND YOU GO INTO ANOTHER ROOM?

GET ON DOWN
TO REAL FAKE DOORS. THAT'S US.

FILL A WHOLE ROOM UP
WITH THEM.

SEE, WATCH.
CHECK THIS OUT.

WON'T OPEN.

NOT THIS ONE.

NONE OF THEM OPEN.

FAKEDOORS.COM IS OUR WEBSITE,

SO CHECK IT OUT FOR A LOT OF
REALLY GREAT DEALS

ON FAKE DO-O-O-O-RS!

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
RICK.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A COMMERCIAL.

WHAT'S GOING ON?
- RELAX, MORTY.

DON'T... DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
LET'S JUST SEE WHERE THIS GOES.

STEP ON IT!
WE ALL GOT PLACES TO BE!

SON OF A BITCH.

OH, THAT MUST BE WHERE
HE LIVES.

OKAY.

HUH. HE'S MAKING HIMSELF A SANDWICH NOW.

HEY, EVERYBODY.
SO, THIS IS MY HOUSE.

JUST MADE A SANDWICH...
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

STILL HERE, STILL SELLING
FAKE DOORS.

WHAT?

OH, MY GOD.
IT'S STILL THE COMMERCIAL.

WE HAVE FAKE DOORS
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
COME GET FAKE DOORS.

CALL US UP AND ORDER
SOME FAKE DOORS TODAY.

DON'T EVEN HESITATE,
DON'T EVEN WORRY,

AND DON'T EVEN...

ALL RIGHT, I'M BORED.
CHANGE IT.

WAIT, WAIT, RICK.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

THAT'S OUR SLOGAN.

SEE IT ON THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN BELOW OUR NAME.

HERE'S ANOTHER SLOGAN
RIGHT BELOW THAT ONE.

WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
COME GET FAKE DOORS.

GET IN HERE QUICK, GET OUT QUICKER

WITH AN ARM OF FAKE DOORS IN YOUR ARMS.

OKAY, OKAY, YOU CAN
CHANGE IT.

I HATE MAMUMANUMS-DAYS,

AND I REALLY COULD GO
FOR SOME ENCHILADAS.

HEY, RICK, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

IT'S JUST LIKE GARFIELD, ONLY
INSTEAD IT'S GAZORPAZORPFIELD.

HEY, ISN'T GAZORPAZORP WHERE
THOSE SEX ROBOTS CAME FROM?

REMEMBER THAT WHOLE THING?

YEAH. HEY, THAT'S A PRETTY...
PRETTY...

THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

YEAH. LET'S WATCH SOME MORE
GAZORPAZORPFIELD.

HEY, JOHN.
IT'S ME, GAZORPAZORPFIELD.

BOY FUCK YOU, JOHN,

YOU FUCKIN' DUMB,
STUPID IDIOT.

COME ON, GAZORPAZORPFIELD.
GO EASY ON ME, HUH?

YOU DUMB, STUPID, WEAK,

PATHETIC, WHITE, WHITE,

UH... GUILT...

WHITE-GUILT MILQUETOAST

PIECE OF HUMAN GARBAGE.

GEEZ, GAZORPAZORPFIELD,
THAT'S...

YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
PRETTY MEAN TO ME,

BUT THAT TAKES THE CAKE.

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

I'M GAZORPAZORP-FUCKIN'- FIELD, BITCH.

NOW GIVE ME MY
FUCKING ENCHILADAS.

HEY, RICK, YOU KNOW, DID THEY
USE BILL MURRAY FOR THIS?

SOUNDS A LOT LIKE
BILL MURRAY.

NO, MORTY,
IT'S LORENZO MUSIC.

IN THIS REALITY,
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

OH, OKAY.
WAS HIS NAME "LORENZO MUSIC"?

YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.

HE ALSO DID THE VOICE OF THAT
ONE GUY FROM "GHOSTBUSTERS,"

WHICH IS REALLY STRANGE
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME CHARACTER

BILL MURRAY PLAYED
IN THE MOVIE.

BUT THEN, WHEN THEY
MADE THE MOVIE,

BILL MURRAY DID THE VOICE
OF GAZORPAZORP...

- OR GARFIELD, I MEAN.
- THAT'S PRETTY COOL, RICK.

SO ALL THAT HAPPENED
IN THIS REALITY, TOO?

I DON'T KNOW.

JUST MAKING CONVERSATION
WITH YOU, MORTY.

WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A... I'M...

I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT
EVERYTHING?

DID YOU REALLY TALK ME
OUT OF THE ABORTION?

WELL, WE... WE BLEW A TIRE
ON THE WAY TO THE CLINIC.

I THINK, IN MY HEAD, I WAS
DOING IT ALL FOR THE KIDS.

AND NOW THE FIRST KID IS GOING
TO DO SOMETHING WITH TURQUOISE.

WHICH IS EITHER
CODE FOR CRYSTAL METH

OR A GATEWAY TO IT.

SO WE DIDN'T DO
THE KIDS ANY FAVORS.

SO WE SHOULD STAY TOGETHER
FOR EACH OTHER AND OURSELVES,

OR...

OR...

MAN, WOMAN,
AND NOW TRUNKMAN?

WE KNOW SCIENCE HAS CREATED
MEN THAT HAVE A TRUNK

THAT ALLOWS THEM
TO HAVE SEX WITH BOTH

MALE AND FEMALE PARTNERS.

BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF
THESE PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED.

PUT A LINE IN THE SAND,
EVERYBODY.

VOTE "NO" ON PROPOSITION XW2.

THE ACT THAT SAYS TRUNK PEOPLE
CAN GET MARRIED.

WHO NEEDS IT?

NOT ON MY WATCH.

PAID FOR BY MICHAEL DENNY
AND THE DENNY SINGERS.

HI. I'M A TRUNKPERSON,
AND I WANT...

I FEEL LOVE IN MY HEART, TOO,
JUST LIKE YOU.

I WANNA BE ABLE
TO EXPRESS THAT LOVE

WITH BOTH A MAN
AND A WOMAN.

AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO

IF DENNY AND THE DENNY SINGERS
GET THEIR WAY.

HEY, LET THE TRUNKPEOPLE HAVE
SEX AND GET MARRIED, HUH?

PAID FOR BY TRUNKPEOPLE.

OH, I LOVE ME
STRAWBERRY SNIGGLES.

OOH, I HOPE NOBODY EVER GETS
MY HANDS ON ME

AND TRIES TO STEAL
MY STRAWBERRY SMIGGLES.

I'M GONNA EAT EVERY LAST
ONE OF THEM,

BECAUSE... AND THEN
THEY'LL BE IN MY STOMACH,

AND NOBODY WILL EVER BE
ABLE TO EAT THEM.

EXCEPT FOR ME, BECAUSE THEY'LL
BE ALL INSIDE MY STOMACH.

UM, MY NAME IS
MR. TOPHAT JONES,

AND GOD FORBID ANYONE EVER
TAKE MY SNER...

LITTLE-PEOPLE SNIBBLES.

I'M KEEPING THEM ALL FOR ME.

MMM. MMM.

LAST BITE.
MMM.

OH, NOW THEY'RE ALL RESTING
COMFORTABLY IN MY STOMACH.

OOH, AM I FEELING GOOD.

NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

THERE'S NO MORE STRAWBERRY
SNIBBLES... NO!

JESUS CHRIST!

JESUS CHRIST! IT HURTS!

MY ENTRAILS ARE OUT!

WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT
TO EAT THESE?

THEY'RE SOAKED
WITH MY STOMACH ACID.

OH, JESUS CHRIST,
LORD, SAVIOR,

AND SPIRIT,
SAVE ME.

TAKE ME TO THE LIGHT.

OH, MY GOD. I SEE DEMONS.

I SEE DEMONS ARE COMING!

GEEZ, RICK.
OH, MY GOD.

THAT'S SOME PRETTY
HARD-CORE STUFF,

YOU KNOW, FOR A CEREAL
COMMERCIAL.

WELL, MORTY... I MEAN, YOU
WANNA SELL BOXES OF CEREAL,

YOU GOTTA PUMP THE GAS
A LITTLE.

PEDAL TO THE METAL, MORTY.

IN A WORLD WHERE MUSCULAR
MANNIES ARE COMING,

AND THEY'RE COMING STRONG,

THERE'S ONLY THREE
UNMUSCULAR MICHAELS.

GET DOWN. HURRY. RUN.

AND THAT'S WHEN REAL
TURBULENT JUICE IS COMING,

AND YOU GOT TO TAKE
CARE OF IT.

WITH TURBULENT JUICE,
TURBULENT TABLES,

NO ROOM IS SAFE
FROM THE TURBULENT POWER

OF TURBULENT JUICE.

- WHAT IN THE HELL?
- SEX SELLS, MORTY.

SEX SELLS WHAT?

WAS THAT A MOVIE OR, LIKE,
DOES IT CLEAN STUFF?

HEY, DAD.

- GOD.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

WELL, YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE GONNA BE SPENDING

SOME TIME APART, MORTY.

AND YOUR SISTER FOUND OUT
SHE WAS AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY.

- WHAT?
- SPEAKING OF WHAT,

MORTY,
WHAT SHOULD WE WATCH NEXT?

WHAT ABOUT THIS?

BABYLEGS, YOU'RE A GOOD
DETECTIVE.

BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
BECAUSE OF YOUR BABY LEGS.

SO I'M PARTNERING YOU UP
WITH REGULARLEGS.

HEY, THERE.

DETECTIVE, I'M...
THIS IS UPSETTING TO ME

BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I DON'T
NEED NO REGULAR-LEG PARTNER.

BABYLEGS, DON'T TALK
BACK TO ME.

GOOD LUCK, YOU TWO.

THERE'S A CRIMINAL TO KILL.

WOW, YOU SURE FOUND
THIS GUY QUICK.

UH, YEAH, BECAUSE I'M A GOOD
DETECTIVE.

LOOK, BABYLEGS.
IT'S THE CRIMINAL.

OH, FUCK IT. I'M THE KILLER.
I'M RUNNING.

I'M RUNNING REAL QUICK.

BABYLEGS, HERE WE GO!

THAT'S THE SOUND I MAKE
WHEN I'M TRYING TO RUN FAST.

ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT
GONNA GET HIM.

I JUST LEARNED A REAL
VALUABLE LESSON.

I'M COMING, BABYLEGS.

I'M... REGULARLEGS.

WE GOT HIM.

HEY, THAT WAS GOOD TEAMWORK.

BABYLEGS AND REGULARLEGS,

I'M PROUD OF YOU TWO
FOR WORKING TOGETHER.

AND, BABYLEGS, I KNOW
IT WAS HARD FOR YOU

TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT YOU NEED A PARTNER,

BUT I'M PROUD OF YOU
THAT YOU DID IT.

HEY, THANKS, CHIEF.

NOW GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

PRETTY COOL, HUH,
MORTY?

OH.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT
YOU THINK, JERRY.

HEY, UH, Y-YOU DOING OKAY?

I KIND OF KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
SUMMER.

NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE THE LITTLE BROTHER.

YOU'RE NOT THE CAUSE OF YOUR
PARENTS MISERY.

YOU'RE JUST A SYMPTOM OF IT.

- CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?
- MORTY, NO OFFENSE...

BUT A DRAWING OF ME YOU MADE
WHEN YOU WERE EIGHT

ISN'T GONNA MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
LESS OF AN ACCIDENT.

THAT OUT THERE?
THAT'S MY GRAVE.

- WAIT, WHAT?
- ON ONE OF OUR ADVENTURES...

RICK AND I BASICALLY
DESTROYED THE WHOLE WORLD,

SO WE BAILED ON THAT REALITY,
AND WE CAME TO THIS ONE.

BECAUSE IN THIS ONE,
THE WORLD WASN'T DESTROYED.

AND IN THIS ONE,
WE WERE DEAD.

SO WE CAME HERE AND...
AND WE BURIED OURSELVES,

AND WE TOOK THEIR PLACE.

AND EVERY MORNING, SUMMER,
I EAT BREAKFAST

20 YARDS AWAY
FROM MY OWN ROTTING CORPSE.

SO YOU'RE NOT MY
BROTHER?

I'M BETTER THAN YOUR
BROTHER.

I'M A VERSION OF YOUR BROTHER
YOU CAN TRUST

WHEN HE SAYS "DON'T RUN."

NOBODY EXISTS ON PURPOSE.
NOBODY BELONGS ANYWHERE.

EVERYBODY'S GONNA DIE.

COME WATCH TV.

MRS. SULLIVAN ALWAYS PLANNED

TO LEAVE EVERYTHING

YES, SWEETIE.

IN THE GARAGE.

YEAH, RICK, IT'S GREAT.

- IS THIS THE SURPRISE?
- MORTY, I HAD TO...

I HAD TO... I HAD TO...
I HAD TO MAKE A BOMB, MORTY.

- I HAD TO CREATE A BOMB.
- WHAT?! A BOMB?!

WE'RE GONNA DROP IT DOWN THERE JUST
GET A WHOLE FRESH START, MORTY.

- CREATE A WHOLE FRESH START.
- T-T-THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!

COME ON, MORTY.
JUST TAKE IT EASY, MORTY.

IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA GO PICK
UP YOUR LITTLE FRIEND JESSICA.

JESSICA?
FROM MY MATH CLASS?

WHEN I DROP THE BOMB...

YOU KNOW, I WANT YOU TO

HAVE SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW I
WANT YOU TO HAVE THE THING

I'M GONNA MAKE IT LIKE A NEW ADAM
AND EVE, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ADAM.

AND JESSICA'S GONNA BE EVE,
AND SO THAT'S THE SURPRISE, MORTY.

NO, YOU CAN'T!

JESSICA DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW I EXIST.

BUT BUT FORGET ABOUT THAT,

BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
BLOW UP HUMANITY.

I-I GET WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY, MORTY.

LISTEN, I'M NOT YOU
DON'T YOU DON'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT ME...

TRYING TO FOOL AROUND WITH WITH JESSICA
OR MESS AROUND WITH JESSICA OR ANYTHING.

I'M I'M NOT THAT
KIND OF GUY, MORTY.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, RICK?

YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ME GETTING WITH JESSICA OR ANYTHING.

SHE SHE SHE SHE...
SHE'S ALL FOR YOU, MORTY.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT JESSICA!

YOU KNOW WHAT, MORTY?

YOU'RE RIGHT.

LET'S FORGET THE GIRL ALL
TOGETHER.

SHE SHE'S PROBABLY NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE, ANYWAYS.

ARMING NEUTRINO BOMB.

THAT'S IT THAT'S IT, RICK.

I'M TAKING THE WHEEL.

GET OFF OF ME, MORTY!

I'M TAKING CHARGE OF
THIS SITUATION, BUDDY.

WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

I'M I'M I'M I'M NOT GONNA STAND
AROUND LIKE SOME SORT OF DUMB...

WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

...PERSON AND JUST
LET YOU BLOW UP THE WHOLE WORLD.

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

I'LL I'LL LAND.

I'LL LAND. I'LL LAND.

I'LL LAND THE THING.

BIG TOUGH GUY ALL OF A SUDDEN.

WE'LL PARK IT RIGHT HERE, MORTY.

RIGHT HERE ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD HERE.

OH, THANK GOD.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

THAT WAS ALL A TEST, MORTY.

JUST AN ELABORATE TEST TO MAKE
YOU MORE ASSERTIVE.

IT WAS?

SURE. WHY NOT?
I DON'T KNOW.

YOU YOU KNOW WHAT, MO-

NEUTRINO BOMB ARMED.

UM...

I SEE THERE'S A NEW EPISODE OF
THAT SINGING SHOW TONIGHT.

WHO DO YOU GUYS THINK IS GONNA
BE THE BEST SINGER?

OH, MY GOD.
HIS HEAD IS IN HIS FOOD.

- I'M GOING TO PUKE.
- MORTY, ARE YOU GETTING SICK?

I TOLD YOU NOT TO PRACTICE-KISS
THE LIVING-ROOM PILLOW.

THE DOG SLEEPS ON IT.

I WASN'T KISSING A PILLOW, MOM.

I JUST I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

MAYBE MY DREAMS WERE JUST TOO
LOUD OR SOMETHING.

OR MAYBE YOU WERE OUT ALL NIGHT
AGAIN WITH GRANDPA RICK.

- WHAT?!
- DAD?

WHAT, SO EVERYONE'S SUPPOSED TO
SLEEP EVERY SINGLE NIGHT NOW?

YOU REALIZE THAT NIGHTTIME MAKES
UP HALF OF ALL TIME?

DAMN IT!

- JERRY!
- BETH!

OH, MY GOD.

MY PARENTS ARE SO LOUD.
I WANT TO DIE.

MM, THERE IS NO GOD, SUMMER. YOU
GOT TO RIP THAT BAND-AID OFF NOW.

YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.

OKAY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, RICK...
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

WHAT RESPECT IS DUE?

HOW IS MY SON SUPPOSED TO PASS
HIS CLASSES IF YOU KEEP DRAGGING HIM OFF

FOR HIGH-CONCEPT
SCI-FI RIGAMAROLE?

LISTEN, JERRY, I DON'T WANT TO
OVERSTEP MY BOUNDS OR ANYTHING.

IT'S YOUR HOUSE.
IT'S YOUR WORLD.

YOU'RE A REAL JULIUS CAESAR.

BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOME TELL YOU HOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT SCHOOL, JERRY.

IT'S A WASTE OF TIME A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
RUNNING AROUND, BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER.

G-GUY UP FRONT SAYS,
"TWO PLUS TWO."

THE PEOPLE IN THE
BACK SAY, "FOUR."

THEN THE BELL RINGS, AND THEY
GIVE YOU A CARTON OF MILK

AND A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS YOU
CAN GO TAKE A DUMP OR SOMETHING.

I MEAN, IT'S IT'S NOT A PLACE
FOR SMART PEOPLE, JERRY.

AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT
A POPULAR OPINION,

BUT IT'S MY TWO
CENTS ON THE ISSUE.

THIS WAS A GOOD BREAKFAST, BETH.

YOU REALLY MADE THE
CRAP OUT OF THOSE EGGS.

I WISH YOUR MOTHER WAS
HERE TO EAT THEM.

OH, DAD.

WHAT? FOR REAL?

ALL RIGHT, NOW,
EVERYBODY GET SETTLED.

GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS!

NOW, LOOK, WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING
WITH SOME REAL SERIOUS STUFF TODAY.

YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF IT.
IT'S CALLED MATH.

AND WITHOUT IT, NONE OF US WOULD
EVEN EXIST, SO LET'S JUMP RIGHT IN.

- TWO PLUS TWO.
- JESSICA.

FIVE PLUS FIVE.

TENSSICA.

OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S TIME FOR THE QUIZ.

YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?!
AW, TOO BAD!

TOUGH!

FIRST ROW, TAKE ONE.
PASS IT BACK FOR ME.

THE STAKES ARE
HIGH IN THIS ROOM.

THERE'S CRUCIAL THINGS HAPPENING
HERE EVERY DAY.

PEOPLE GETTING SMARTER.
SOME OF Y'ALL GETTING DUMBER.

SOME OF Y'ALL AIN'T
GONNA SEE 3:00.

HI, MORTY.

WHOA!
HI, JESSICA.

CAN I SHOW THESE TO YOU?

WOW.

TH-THEY'RE BOTH GREAT.
THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT I NAMED THESE?
MY LITTLE MORTIES.

UH, THAT'S
FLATTERING... AND A LITTLE WEIRD.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO WITH THEM?

RENAME THEM?

SQUEEZE THEM.

MANHANDLE THEM.
GIVE THEM THE BUSINESS.

SEE IF YOU CAN SHUFFLE THEM.

I MEAN, REALLY GET IN THERE AND
KNOCK THEM AROUND.

- NO WRONG ANSWERS.
- WOW.

WELL, OKAY, JESSICA.
L-LET'S GIVE THIS A SHOT.

MM.

OH, MORTY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

UH, I-I'M JUST DOING MY BEST.

MORTY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?!

JESSICA.

MORTY!

JESSICA.

FIVE MORE MINUTES OF THIS,
AND I'M GONNA GET MAD.

JE-JESSICA.

JESSICA.

NOT MY FAULT THIS IS HAPPENING.

WELL, WELL, WELL.

- UH, MORNING, FRANK.
- "MORNING"?

WHAT WAS WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY MY
FAMILY'S POOR?

OH, GEEZ, FRANK.

I DON'T KNOW IF A KNIFE IS
NECESSARY.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, Y-YOU KIND OF
HAD THINGS HANDLED WITHOUT IT.

YOU TELLING ME HOW TO BULLY NOW?
BIG MISTAKE, MORTY.

AND NOW I'M GONNA CUT YOU,
'CAUSE MY FAMILY'S RICH.

THERE YOU ARE, MORTY.
LISTEN TO ME.

I GOT AN ERRAND TO RUN IN A
WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

I NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.

OH, GEEZ, RICK.
WHAT'D YOU DO TO FRANK?

IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS, MORTY.
I FROZE HIM.

NOW LISTEN I NEED
YOUR HELP, MORTY.

I MEAN, WE GOT WE GOT TO GET GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE AND GO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.

- IT'S IMPORTANT. COME ON, MORTY.
- I DON'T KNOW, RICK.

I CAN'T LEAVE SCHOOL AGAIN.

DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF HOW MUCH
HIGHER THE STAKES GET OUT THERE, MORTY?

WHAT DO YOU THINK I CAN JUST
DO IT ALL BY MYSELF?

COME ON!

AW, GEEZ. OKAY.
I GUESS I CAN SKIP HISTORY.

WHAT ABOUT FRANK?

I MEAN, SHOULDN'T
YOU UNFREEZE HIM?

I'LL DO IT LATER, MORTY.
HE'LL BE FINE.

LET'S GO.

OH, MY GOD. I'M ABOUT TO
WALK PAST FRANK PALICKY.

THIS IS THE STORY WE'LL BE
TELLING OUR CHILDREN.

HI, FRANK.

AAH!

- SCALPEL.
- SCALPEL.

KNOCK, KNOCK.

JERRY?

MY MANAGER GAVE ME AN
HOUR FOR LUNCH, AND I THOUGHT,

"HEY, WHY NOT SWING BY WHERE
YOUR WIFE WORKS?"

WE'RE LOSING HIM.
OKAY, HE'S BACK.

JERRY, PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE HERE
FOR AN INCREDIBLY URGENT REASON.

WELL, IT'S LUNCH.

I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THREE MEALS
THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR MILLENNIA.

LOSING HIM.

STABILIZED.

OKAY, I ONLY ASK, JERRY,
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,

MY JOB INVOLVES
PERFORMING HEART SURGERY.

- WELL, YEAH, ON HORSES.
- EXCUSE ME?

OKAY.
LET'S NOT REHASH THAT FIGHT.

I SENSE THAT YOU'RE BUSY AND
WILL NOW BE ON MY WAY.

WHOA!

WHAT IS THIS ON THE FLOOR?

SOME KIND OF LITERATURE FOR A
REALLY NICE-LOOKING NURSING HOME.

HEY, HONEY, CRAZY IDEA BAD PITCH
LET'S PUT YOUR DAD HERE.

LET'S PUT YOUR DAD
IN A NURSING HOME.

WE'RE LOSING HIM.

HEY, TOM.
WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE LOSING HIM.

WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!

THERE SHE IS.

ALL RIGHT. COME ON, MORTY.
LET'S GO.

OH, GEEZ. OKAY.

OH, MAN, RICK.

WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

IT'S DIMENSION 35C,

AND IT'S GOT THE PERFECT
CLIMATE CONDITIONS

FOR A SPECIAL TYPE
OF TREE, MORTY, CALLED A MEGA TREE,

AND THERE'S FRUIT IN THOSE TREES,
AND THERE'S SEEDS IN THOSE FRUITS.

I'M TALKING ABOUT MEGA SEEDS.

THEY'RE THEY'RE
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL,

AND I NEED THEM TO HELP ME
WITH MY RESEARCH, MORTY.

OH, MAN, RICK.
I'M LOOKING AROUND THIS PLACE,

AND I'M STARTING TO WORK UP SOME
ANXIETY ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN. LISTEN TO ME, MORTY.

I KNOW THAT NEW SITUATIONS CAN
BE INTIMIDATING.

YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND,
AND IT'S ALL SCARY AND DIFFERENT,

BUT, YOU KNOW,
M-MEETING THEM HEAD ON,

CHARGING RIGHT INTO THEM LIKE A
BULL THAT'S HOW WE GROW AS PEOPLE.

I'M NO STRANGER TO
SCARY SITUATIONS.

I DEAL WITH THEM ALL THE TIME.

NOW, IF YOU JUST STICK WITH ME,

MORTY, WE'RE GONNA BE HOLY
CRAP, MORTY, RUN!

I NEVER SEEN THAT THING
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE HELL IT IS!

WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE,
MORTY!

IT'S GONNA KILL US!

WE'RE GONNA DIE!

WE'RE GONNA DIE, MORTY!

OH, MORTY, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

BREATHE THAT BREATHE THAT
FRESH AIR IN, MORTY.

Y-YOU SMELL THAT?

THAT'S THE SMELL OF
ADVENTURE, MORTY.

THAT'S THAT'S THE SMELL OF

OF OF OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT
EVOLUTIONARY TIMELINE.

ALL RIGHT, RICK, LOOK HOW
MUCH LONGER IS THIS GONNA BE?

SHOULDN'T I BE BACK
AT SCHOOL BY NOW?

ARE YOU JOKING ME?

I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THE CRAZY
CRAP SURROUNDING US.

LOOK AT THAT THING RIGHT THERE.
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?

YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT
KIND OF THING AT SCHOOL?

LOOK AT IT JUST
LUMBERING AROUND.

IT DEFIES ALL LOGIC THAT THING.

YEAH, RICK, I GET IT.

WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MONSTERS.

THAT'S KIND OF THE REASON
WHY I WANT TO LEAVE.

TA-TA-TA-TA-TA-TA.

MORTY, YOU SEE THIS?

YOU SEE WHAT WE JUST
STUMBLED UPON, MORTY?

ANY IDEA WHAT THAT
IS DOWN THERE?

THE MEGA TREES?

THAT'S RIGHT, MORTY THE MEGA TREES
WITH THE MEGA FRUIT ON THEM.

AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, MORTY.

THAT'S WHERE MY SEEDS ARE.

IF WE WOULD HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU WANTED,

I WOULD HAVE NEVER
HAVE FOUND THEM,

BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO IN LOVE WITH SCHOOL.

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

SO, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT
THESE SEEDS, ANYWAYS?

YOU ASK A LOT OF
QUESTIONS, MORTY.

NOT VERY CHARISMATIC.

IT MAKES YOU KIND OF AN
UNDER UNDERFOOT FIGURE.

JUST TAKE THESE SHOES, MORTY.

THEY'RE SPECIAL GRAPPLING SHOES.

WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THESE
THINGS, THESE BABIES,

YOU CAN BASICALLY JUST WALK ON
ANY SURFACE YOU WANT, MORTY

UP, DOWN, BELOW, TURN AROUND TO
THE LEFT.

THESE THINGS REALLY BRING IT ALL
TOGETHER.

AAH!

YOU HAVE TO TURN THEM ON, MORTY!

THE SHOES HAVE TO BE TURNED ON!

I AM NOT PUTTING MY
FATHER IN A HOME!

HE JUST CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE,

AND YOU WANT TO GRAB HIM
AND STUFF HIM

UNDER A MATTRESS LIKE LAST
MONTH'S VICTORIA'S SECRET?

I TOLD YOU I WAS ORDERING YOU
SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOUR FATHER IS
A HORRIBLE INFLUENCE ON OUR SON.

EVERYTHING COOL IN HERE, BETH?

- IT'S FINE, DAVIN.
- OKAY, COOL.

YOU KNOW, WE DID
SOMETHING GREAT TODAY.

THERE'S NOTHING MORE NOBLE AND
FREE THAN THE HEART OF A HORSE.

SINCE WE'RE FIGHTING, IF YOU EVER
HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH THAT GUY,

I WILL COME TO THE HOTEL ROOM AND BLOW MY
BRAINS OUT ALL OVER YOUR NAKED BODIES.

LOOK, I APPRECIATE THE
STRESS YOU'RE UNDER, BUT...

MORTY WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN SCHOOL
WAY BEFORE MY DAD MOVED IN,

AND THE ONLY INFLUENCE I
CAN SEE RICK HAVING...

IS THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
HIS LIFE, MORTY HAS A FRIEND.

WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

UH, YEAH, MAYBE I AM.

I'M MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER.
I'M SMART.

WHY DO YOU THINK I'M
A HEART SURGEON?

HORSE HEART SURGEON.

HELLO?

MRS. SMITH?

THIS IS PRINCIPAL VAGINA,
NO RELATION.

I WONDER IF YOU AND MORTY'S
FATHER MIGHT BE ABLE

TO HAVE A CHAT
WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON?

MORTY, OH, YOU REALLY D-DID A
NUMBER ON YOUR LEGS RIGHT NOW.

YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO TURN THE SHOES
ON, MORTY, FOR THEM TO WORK.

YEAH, LOOK I TURNED MINE ON.
I HAD NO PROBLEM GETTING DOWN HERE.

IT WAS A LEISURELY BREEZE.

I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN, RICK.

YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

BUT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE
TO HELP ME COLLECT MY SEEDS, MORTY?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

THAT'S IT, RICK!

THAT'S THE LAST STRAW!

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

I'M SITTING HERE WITH
BOTH OF MY LEGS BROKEN,

AND YOU'RE STILL ASKING ME
ABOUT GETTING THOSE SEEDS?!

OOH! OW! OH!

Y-Y-YOU'RE A MONSTER.

Y-YOU'RE LIKE HITLER, BUT

BUT EVEN HITLER CARED ABOUT
GERMANY OR SOMETHING.

OKAY, HOLD ON JUST A
SECOND, MORTY.

OOH.

OHH.

OOH.

WOW, RICK.

THAT STUFF JUST HEALED MY BROKEN
LEGS INSTANTLY.

I MEAN, I'VE NEVER FELT
SO GOOD IN MY LIFE.

THANK YOU.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MORTY.

JUST COME HELP ME GET THESE
SEEDS, ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

SURE THING, RICK.

NOT THAT YOU ASKED,

MORTY, BUT WHAT JUST
HAPPENED THERE IS...

I WENT INTO A FUTURE DIMENSION WITH
SUCH ADVANCED MEDICINE...

THAT THEY HAD BROKEN-LEG SERUM AT
EVERY CORNER DRUGSTORE.

THE STUFF WAS ALL OVER THE
PLACE, MORTY.

WOW, THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY, RICK.

THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM,
MORTY ONE LITTLE HANG-UP.

THE DIMENSION I VISITED WAS SO

ADVANCED, THEY HAD ALSO HALTED

THE AGING PROCESS, AND EVERYONE

THERE WAS YOUNG, MORTY, AND THEY
HAD BEEN FOREVER.

I WAS THE ONLY OLD
PERSON THERE, MORTY.

IT WAS LIKE I WAS SOME SORT OF, YOU
KNOW, CELEBRITY, WALKING AROUND.

I-I WAS FASCINATING TO THEM.

THERE WERE A LOT OF ATTRACTIVE
WOMEN THERE, MORTY,

AND THEY THEY THEY THEY
ALL WANTED TIME WITH ME.

I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH
A LOT OF YOUNG LADIES,

BUT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME THERE,

MY INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTAL DEVICE
IT'S GOT NO CHARGE LEFT, MORTY.

- IT'S GOT NO CHARGE LEFT.
- WHAT?!

IT'S AS GOOD AS GARBAGE, MORTY.

IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
ANYMORE, MORTY.

OH, GEEZ, RICK, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

W-WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

I-I HAVE TO BE BACK AT SCHOOL
RIGHT NOW.

HOW ARE WE GONNA GET BACK HOME?

THERE'S WAYS TO GET
BACK HOME, MORTY.

IT'S JUST IT'S JUST GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH
INTERDIMENSIONAL CUSTOMS,

SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO ME A REAL SOLID.

UH-OH.

WHEN WE GET TO CUSTOMS,

I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO TAKE
THESE SEEDS INTO THE BATHROOM,

AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO PUT THEM
WAY UP INSIDE YOUR BUTTHOLE, MORTY.

IN MY BUTT?

PUT THEM WAY UP INSIDE THERE,
AS FAR AS THEY CAN FIT.

OH, GEEZ, RICK.

I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO DO THAT.

WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
DO IT, MORTY.

TH-THESE SEEDS AREN'T GONNA GET

THROUGH CUSTOMS UNLESS THEY'RE
IN SOMEONE'S RECTUM, MORTY.

AND THEY'LL FALL RIGHT
OUT OF MINE.

I'VE DONE THIS TOO
MANY TIMES, MORTY.

I MEAN, YOU'RE YOUNG.

YOU'VE GOT YOUR WHOLE
LIFE AHEAD OF YOU,

AND YOUR ANAL CAVITY IS
STILL TAUT, YET MALLEABLE.

YOU GOT TO DO IT FOR GRANDPA,
MORTY.

Y-YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THESE SEEDS
INSIDE YOUR BUTT.

- IN MY BUTT?
- COME ON, MORTY.

PLEASE, MORTY.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT, MORTY.

OH, MAN.

THE FACT IS, YOUR SON, MORTY,

HAS ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL FOR A

TOTAL OF SEVEN HOURS OVER THE
LAST TWO MONTHS.

WHAT?
WHY DIDN'T YOU NOTIFY US?

I DONE BEEN NOTIFYING YOU.

HAVE YOU NOT BEEN GETTING THE

MESSAGES I'VE BEEN LEAVING WITH
MORTY'S GRANDFATHER?

BOOM!

TOLD YOU! IN YOUR FACE!
HE IS RUINING OUR CHILD!

WAIT, WHAT AM I CELEBRATING?

YEAH, SEE, I THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS FISHY THERE,

BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY
MORTY'S GRANDPA

THAT'S TAKING HIM OUT OF SCHOOL.

SUMMER?

WHAT KIND
OF GOD LETS THIS HAPPEN?

WE HAD A LITTLE INCIDENT.

A STUDENT WAS FROZEN TO DEATH.

AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT A
LATINO STUDENT DID IT!

EVERYONE WANTS TO TAKE THIS
TO A RACIAL PLACE.

I WON'T LET THEM.

THE GLARP ZONE IS FOR
FLARPING AND UNGLARPING ONLY.

SO, I TOLD HIM, "GIVE ME THE
BLIMFARX," YOU KNOW?

THIS THIS GUY HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND INTERSTELLAR CURRENCY.

IT'S, LIKE, I'M TRYING TO EAT

A FLIMFLAM LIKE, THAT'S WHAT
WE EAT ON GIRVONESK.

THE GLARP ZONE IS FOR
FLARPING AND UNGLARPING ONLY.

I DON'T LIKE IT HERE, MORTY.
I CAN'T ABIDE BUREAUCRACY.

I DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD WHERE TO
GO AND WHAT TO DO.

I CONSIDER IT A VIOLATION.

DID YOU GET THOSE SEEDS ALL THE
WAY UP YOUR BUTT?

YEAH, RICK.

LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH, OKAY?

I MEAN, THESE THINGS ARE POINTY.

THEY HURT.

THAT MEANS THEY'RE GOOD ONES.

YOU'RE A GOOD KID, MORTY.

THOSE MEGA SEEDS ARE SUPER
VALUABLE TO MY WORK.

YOU'VE BEEN A HUGE HELP TO ME.

I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO
ALL KIND OF THINGS WITH THEM.

IT'S GONNA BE GREAT, MORTY.

ALL KINDS OF SCIENCE.

OKAY, NEXT THROUGH.

EXCEPT YOU. YOU GO OVER THERE.

WHY DOES HE HAVE TO GO
OVER THERE?

RANDOM CHECK.

HE'S GOT TO GO THROUGH
THE NEW MACHINE.

WHAT NEW MACHINE?

IT'S A NEW MACHINE.

IT DETECTS STUFF ALL THE WAY UP
YOUR BUTT.

RUN, MORTY! RUN!

AAH!

RED ALERT!

OHHHHH!

HEY! OHHHHHH.

AAH!

DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!

OOH!

OH, NICE, MORTY!

THE STUDENT BECOMES THE TEACHER.

WHOOOOOO!

AAH!

AW, HELL, NO, DAWG.

YOU KNOW ME I'M JUST TRYING TO-

AAH!

I NEED TO TYPE IN THE COORDINATES
TO OUR HOME WORLD, MORTY.

- COVER ME.
- OH, MAN.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I-I DON'T WANT
TO SHOOT NOBODY.

THEY'RE JUST ROBOTS, MORTY!

IT'S OKAY TO SHOOT THEM!
THEY'RE ROBOTS!

AAH!

MY LEG IS SHOT OFF!

GLENN'S BLEEDING TO DEATH!

SOMEONE CALL HIS
WIFE AND CHILDREN!

THEY'RE NOT ROBOTS, RICK!

IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH, MORTY.

THEY'RE BUREAUCRATS.
I DON'T RESPECT THEM.

JUST KEEP SHOOTING, MORTY.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PRISON
IS LIKE HERE!

HOLY CRAP!
THIS IS INSANE!

COME ON, MORTY!

WE GOT TO GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE!

WOW.

DID YOU JUST COME INTO THE
CAFETERIA THROUGH A PORTAL?

UH, YEAH.

WELL, YOU KNOW, MY MY
FERRARI'S IN THE SHOP.

JUST KIDDING.

- YOU'RE MORTY, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

YOU CAN GET HIS NUMBER LATER.
COME ON, MORTY.

WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

YOU GOT TO GET THOSE SEEDS OUT
OF YOUR ASS.

OH, LOOK, HONEY. IT'S OUR
SON WITH ALBERT EIN-DOUCHE.

WHAT?

I'M AN ANGRY FATHER,
NOT AN IMPROVISOR.

OH, HI, JERRY.

OH, MY GOODNESS, MORTY!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF CLASS?

WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

YOUR YOUR PARENTS AND I ARE VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN IN THIS BEHAVIOR.

NO? NO TAKERS?

YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY NOT BE
TOUCHING THAT STUFF.

- IT'S BEYOND YOUR REASONING.
- YOU'RE BEYOND OUR REASONING!

TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

DAD, HOW COULD YOU MAKE

MY SON MISS AN ENTIRE
SEMESTER OF SCHOOL?

I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S A HOT
GIRL.

HE CAN'T JUST BAIL ON HIS LIFE AND
SET UP SHOP IN SOMEONE ELSE'S.

WHAT WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING WITH MY STUFF?

WE'RE MOVING YOU... TO A
NURSING HOME.

A NURSING HOME?

WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

I'M A GENIUS.
I BUILD ROBOTS FOR FUN.

WELL, NOW YOU CAN
BUILD BASKETS AND WATCH

PAUL NEWMAN MOVIES ON VHS...

AND MENTALLY SCAR THE BOY SCOUTS
EVERY CHRISTMAS.

- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- IT'S PERSONAL.

DAD, MOM, COME ON.

RICK JUST NEEDED MY HELP IS ALL.

MORTY, STAY OUT OF THIS.

YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT CAPABLE OF

JUDGING THESE
SITUATIONS ON YOUR OWN.

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO
SAY ABOUT MORTY?

THAT HE'S STUPID OR SOMETHING?

OH, DON'T HIGH-ROAD US, DAD.

YOU KNOW FULLY WELL THAT MORTY

IS THE LAST CHILD THAT NEEDS TO
BE MISSING CLASSES.

I-I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN BY THAT.

CAN CAN CAN YOU BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC?

OH, FOR CRYING OUT HE'S GOT SOME
KIND OF DISABILITY OR SOMETHING.

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT US TO SAY?

I DO?

WELL, DUH DOY, SON.

LOOK, I LOVE YOU, MORTY, BUT...

WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT AS
FAST AS THE OTHER KIDS,

AND IF YOU WANT
TO COMPETE IN THIS WORLD,

YOU GOT TO WORK TWICE AS HARD.

AW, GEEZ, DAD.

Y-YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT TO DROP
ON A KID ALL AT ONCE.

MORTY, T-TELL YOUR
PARENTS THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI.

OH, COME ON, RICK.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI, MORTY.
GO!

1.77245385.

WHOA!

WHAT THE HELL?

HOLY CRAP. HE'S RIGHT.

MORTY, TELL YOUR PARENTS THE
FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.

"THE INCREMENT IN THE
INTERNAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM IS...

EQUAL TO THE INCREMENT OF HEAT
SUPPLIED TO THE SYSTEM."

WOW! I'M SO SMART!

BUT I TOLD THE BOTH OF
YOU SCHOOL IS STUPID.

IT'S NOT HOW YOU LEARN THINGS.

MORTY'S A GIFTED CHILD.
HE HAS A SPECIAL MIND.

THAT'S WHY HE'S
MY LITTLE HELPER.

HE'S LIKE ME.

HE'S GONNA BE DOING GREAT
SCIENCE STUFF LATER IN HIS LIFE.

HE'S TOO SMART FOR SCHOOL.

HE NEEDS TO KEEP HANGING OUT
AND HELPING ME.

JERRY, I DON'T WANT WHATEVER'S
HAPPENING HERE TO STOP.

NO, I-I UNDERSTAND.

UH, MAYBE WE OVERREACTED.

BUT HE HAS TO KEEP
GOING TO SCHOOL.

OKAY, JERRY.

YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, BUT
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

SAY NO?

YOU YOU REALLY WEAR THE PANTS
AROUND HERE.

I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

BETWEEN US, FROM NOW ON,
IT'S GONNA BE

100% HONESTY AND OPEN,
CLEAR COMMUNICATION.

FRANK PALICKY WAS
FROZEN TO DEATH TODAY!

NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

OKAY.

WELL, UH, MORTY, IT'S YOUR
BEDTIME IN AN HOUR.

DON'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT AGAIN.

THIS IS GOOD, THOUGH.
THIS CAN WORK.

I THINK WE CAN BE A FAMILY.

AND NOW, BETH, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME,
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
OKAY.

HOLY COW, RICK.

I DIDN'T KNOW HANGING OUT WITH
YOU WAS MAKING ME SMARTER.

FULL DISCLOSURE, MORTY IT'S NOT.

TEMPORARY SUPERINTELLIGENCE IS
JUST A SIDE EFFECT OF THE MEGA

SEEDS DISSOLVING IN
YOUR RECTAL CAVITY.

AW, MAN.

YEAH, AND ONCE THOSE
SEEDS WEAR OFF,

YOU'RE GONNA LOSE MOST
OF YOUR MOTOR SKILLS,

AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA LOSE
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

BRAIN FUNCTIONALITY FOR 72
HOURS, MORTY.

STARTING RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

OHH, MAN.
OH, GEEZ! OHH.

I'M SORRY, MORTY.
IT'S A BUMMER.

IN REALITY, YOU'RE AS
DUMB AS THEY COME.

AND I NEEDED THOSE SEEDS REAL BAD,
AND I HAD TO GIVE THEM UP

JUST TO GET YOUR
PARENTS OFF MY BACK,

SO NOW WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO GET MORE.

AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO ON EVEN
MORE ADVENTURES AFTER THAT, MORTY.

AND YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR MOUTH
SHUT ABOUT IT, MORTY,

BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FULL OF IDIOTS THAT
DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT'S IMPORTANT, AND THEY'LL
TEAR US APART, MORTY.

BUT IF YOU STICK WITH ME, I'M GONNA
ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS, MORTY,

AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE PART OF THEM,

AND TOGETHER, WE'RE GONNA
RUN AROUND, MORTY.

WE'RE GONNA DO ALL KINDS OF
WONDERFUL THINGS, MORTY.

JUST YOU AND ME, MORTY.

THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS
OUR ENEMY, MORTY.

WE'RE THE ONLY FRIENDS
WE'VE GOT, MORTY.

IT'S JUST RICK AND MORTY. RICK AND
MORTY AND THEIR ADVENTURES, MORTY.

RICK AND MORTY
FOREVER AND FOREVER.

PRINCIPAL VAGINA HERE...

DON'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU.
I'M VERY MUCH IN CHARGE...

REMINDING YOU THAT TONIGHT IS
OUR ANNUAL FLU SEASON DANCE.

I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I HAVE TO SAY THIS,

BUT IF YOU HAVE THE FLU,
STAY HOME.

HEY.

THE FLU SEASON DANCE IS ABOUT
AWARENESS, NOT CELEBRATION.

YOU DON'T BRING DEAD BABIES
TO PASSOVER.

OKAY. HERE WE GO.
H-HEY, JESSICA. UH...

WHAT'S UP, MORTY?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

- UM...
- WAIT, WAIT.

WERE YOU ABOUT TO TALK...
TO HER?

WELL... I MEAN, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IT.

DUDE, STAY IN YOUR LEAGUE.

LOOK AT HOW HOT SHE IS.
YOU DON'T SEE ME GOING...

TO A BIGGER SCHOOL
IN A WEALTHIER DISTRICT

AND HITTING ON THEIR
PRETTIEST GIRL.

GEE, THANKS, BRAD.

I THROW BALLS FAR.

YOU WANT GOOD WORDS?

DATE A LANGUAGER.

TRY NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT, MORTY.

YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
AND THERE'S NOT A PREMIUM

ON THAT RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU'LL BE GETTING GIRLS

SOMETIME AFTER BRAD'S
OUT OF SHAPE.

YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT, DAD.

I DON'T WANT GIRLS.
I WANT JESSICA.

AH, WELL, I REMEMBER
FEELING THAT WAY

ABOUT A YOUNG LADY NAMED
"YOUR MOM,"

AND THAT'S NOT AN URBAN DISS.

YOUR MOM WAS MY JESSICA.

I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HER.

I THOUGHT...
- "I SHOULD GET HER PREGNANT,

AND THEN SHE'LL HAVE
TO MARRY ME."

I BEG YOUR PARDON, RICK...
INAPPROPRIATE.

SORRY, PLEASE PROCEED
WITH YOUR STORY

ABOUT BANGING MY DAUGHTER
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

I'M NOT SURE YOU WANNA TAKE
ROMANTIC ADVICE FROM THIS GUY, MORTY.

HIS MARRIAGE IS HANGING
FROM A THREAD.

MY MARRIAGE IS FINE,
THANK YOU.

JERRY, IT'S YOUR HOUSE...
WHATEVER YOU SAY IT IS

IS HOW IT IS... BUT I THINK
A BLIND MAN COULD SEE

THAT BETH IS LOOKING
FOR THE DOOR.

I BARELY HAVE A REASON TO CARE,
AND EVEN I NOTICED.

COME ON, RICK! DON'T TALK
ABOUT MY PARENTS LIKE THAT.

LISTEN, MORTY, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

BUT WHAT PEOPLE CALL "LOVE"

IS JUST A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT
COMPELS ANIMALS TO BREED.

IT HITS HARD, MORTY,
THEN IT SLOWLY FADES,

LEAVING YOU STRANDED
IN A FAILING MARRIAGE.

I DID IT.
YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA DO IT.

BREAK THE CYCLE, MORTY.

RISE ABOVE. FOCUS ON SCIENCE.

ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA GO
GET DRESSED FOR THE DANCE.

YEAH, I'M JUST GOING TO...
CHECK ON YOUR MOM.

MORTY, HAND ME
THAT SCREWDRIVER, HUH?

I'M ALMOST FINISHED MAKING
MY IONIC DEFIBULIZER, MORTY.

IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
- HEY, LISTEN, RICK.

Y-Y-YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID
THAT, YOU KNOW,

LOVE IS A CHEMICAL
AND ALL THAT STUFF FROM EARLIER?

WELL, I WAS THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

W-W... COULD YOU MAKE SOME SORT
OF CHEMICAL THING HAPPEN

INSIDE OF JESSICA'S MIND,
YOU KNOW,

SO WHERE SHE FALLS IN LOVE
WITH ME

AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING?

YOU KNOW, LIKE, SOME SORT
OF LOVE POTION OR SOMETHING?

MORTY, THAT'S SUCH
A POOR USE OF MY TIME.

IT'S BENEATH ME.
HAND ME THE SCREWDRIVER.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, RICK!

I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU
THE SCREWDRIVER.

I-I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU
ANYTHING EVER AGAIN, RICK!

I'M ALWAYS HELPING YOU WITH THIS
AND THAT AND THE OTHER THING.

W-W-W-W-W-WHAT ABOUT ME,
RICK?

W-W-W-W-WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
HELP ME OUT ONCE...

ONCE... FOR ONCE?

YOU'RE GROWING UP FAST, MORTY.

YOU'RE GROWING INTO A REAL BIG
THORN STRAIGHT UP INTO MY ASS.

LISTEN, THIS IS CALLED
OXYTOCIN.

I EXTRACTED IT FROM A VOLE.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT A VOLE IS,
MORTY?

YOU KNOW WHAT A VOLE IS?
IT'S A... IT'S A RODENT

THAT MATES FOR LIFE,
MORTY.

THIS IS THE CHEMICAL RELEASED
IN A MAMMAL'S BRAIN, YOU KNOW,

THAT MAKES IT FALL IN LOVE.

I JUST GOTTA...
COMBINE IT WITH YOUR DNA.

OH, WELL, OKAY.

A HAIR, MORTY.
I NEED ONE OF YOUR HAIRS.

THIS ISN'T
"GAME OF THRONES."

OW!

ALL RIGHT, MORTY, WHOEVER
YOU SMEAR THIS STUFF ON

WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
AND ONLY YOU, FOREVER.

ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, MORTY?
- HECK, YEAH!

THANK YOU, GRANDPA RICK.

HEY, THERE'S NO...
DANGERS OR ANYTHING,

OR SIDE EFFECTS,
RIGHT?

W-W-W-WHAT AM I,
A HACK?

GO NUTS, MORTY.
IT'S FOOL PROOF.

EH, UNLESS SHE HAS THE FLU.

BETH, DO Y-YOU STILL
LOVE ME?

UGH, WHAT KIND
OF QUESTION IS THAT?

THE "YES OR NO" KIND?

JERRY, DO YOU WANT
HOMELESS PEOPLE TO HAVE HOMES?

YES.

ARE YOU GONNA BUILD
THEM?

NO.

THEN WHAT GOOD WAS
THE "YES"?

WAIT, I-IS LOVING ME THE HOUSE
OR THE HOMELESS PEOPLE?

LOVING YOU IS WORK,
JERRY... HARD WORK,

LIKE BUILDING
A HOMELESS SHELTER...

NOBODY WANTS TO SAY
NO TO DOING IT,

BUT SOME PEOPLE PUT
THE WORK IN.

SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
DO YOU SEE ME WORKING HERE?

DOES THIS CONVERSATION SEEM
TEDIOUS TO ME?

SORT OF.

THEN I OBVIOUSLY
SORT OF LOVE YOU, DON'T I?

SO STOP ASKING, AND MAYBE
I'LL LOVE YOU MORE.

CRAP, THEY NEED ME
AT THE HORSE HOSPITAL.

PUH! THIS LATE?

THE RACETRACK
HAD A STARLIGHT DERBY.

THERE WAS A SEVEN-HORSE
COLLISION,

MORTY!

SHE'S GONNA BE ALONE
WITH THAT GUY ALL NIGHT.

YEAH, DAD, DIGGING
AROUND THE INSIDES OF HORSES.

IT'S NOT A VERY ROMANTIC SETTING.

WELL, SUMMER,
THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY

THAT SHE MADE THE WHOLE
WORK THING UP.

MAYBE DAVIN'S DIGGING AROUND
IN HER INSIDES.

GRANDPA, SO GROSS!
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MY MOM.

WELL, SHE'S
MY DAUGHTER, SUMMER.

I OUTRANK YOU.

OR FAMILY MEANS NOTHING, IN
WHICH CASE DON'T PLAY THAT CARD.

SHE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO MY TEXTS!

CAREFUL, DAD.
JEALOUSY TURNS WOMEN OFF.

WELL, ISN'T THAT
CONVENIENT?

NOT FOR THE MEN
THEY CHEAT ON, NO.

OKAY, I'M...
GOING TO GO OUT...

FOR SOME ICE CREAM.

AND MAYBE
STOP BY THE HOSPITAL...

TO SUPPORT MY WIFE...

WITH MY CONFIDENCE.

GOD, GRANDPA,
YOU'RE SUCH A DICK.

I'M SORRY, SUMMER. YOUR OPINION
MEANS VERY LITTLE TO ME.

HOW COME YOU'RE NOT AT THIS
STUPID DANCE EVERYONE LOVES?

SCREW THAT.
I DON'T WANNA GET SICK.

IT'S FLU SEASON.
- IT IS?

- YEAH.
- UH-OH.

PLEASE JUST LET THIS
WORK OUT.

DO IT, MORTY. DO IT.

RIP MY CLOTHES OFF
AND MATE WITH ME FOR LIFE!

UM... CAN WE MAYBE GO

JESSICA, GET A HOLD OF

MORTY, COME ON!
WE GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS 'CAUSE
IT USUALLY NEVER HAPPENS,

BUT I MADE A MISTAKE.

COME ON, MORTY.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

COME ON.
- MORTY!

ARE YOU OKAY?

- I'M FINE!
- OH, GOOD.

IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO
YOU, I WOULD KILL MYSELF.

I LOVE YOU BAD, MO-MO!

MORTY, THE PRINCIPAL AND I
HAVE DISCUSSED IT,

A-A-AND WE'RE BOTH INSECURE
ENOUGH TO AGREE TO A THREE-WAY!

I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHEN I GAVE YOU THAT SERUM

THAT JESSICA HAD THE FLU...
YOU KNOW,

T-T-T-T-T-THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR ME!

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON, RICK?

WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

T-T-T-THE SERUM IS
PIGGYBACKING ON THE VIRUS.

IT'S GONE AIRBORNE, MORTY.

OH, CRAP.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, RICK?

IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
MORTY, RELAX.

I WHIPPED UP AN ANTIDOTE.

IT'S BASED ON PRAYING-MANTIS
DNA.

YOU KNOW, PRAYING MANTISES
ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF VOLES.

I MEAN, THEY...
THEY MATE ONCE,

AND THEN THEY, YOU KNOW,
DECAPITATE THE PARTNER.

I MEAN, IT'S A WHOLE RITUAL.

IT'S REALLY GRUESOME
AND TOTALLY OPPOSITE.

THERE'S NO LOVE AT ALL.

I-I-I BASICALLY MIXED THIS WITH
A MORE CONTAGIOUS FLU VIRUS.

IT SHOULD NEUTRALIZE
THE WHOLE THING, MORTY.

IT'LL ALL BE OVER
VERY SHORTLY.

UH, BY THE WAY, MORTY, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T ASK OR ANYTHING,

BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

THESE SERUMS, THEY DON'T
WORK ON ANYBODY

RELATED TO YOU
GENETICALLY.

MORTY!

OKAY, WELL, SOMETIMES,

SCIENCE IS MORE ART
THAN SCIENCE, MORTY.

A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
GET THAT.

COME ON.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

HELLO!
- MORTY!

YOU'RE NOT MORTY!
BRING US MORTY!

NOBODY'S KILLING ME...

UNTIL AFTER I CATCH MY WIFE
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

I HAD SEX WITH BILLY.

BUT YOU WERE ALREADY PREGNANT!

YEAH, SO WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

WE INTERRUPT "PREGNANT BABY"
WITH BREAKING NEWS.

COME ON.

THIS JUST IN... MORTY SMITH'S
WHEREABOUTS ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

WHAT THE HELL?

THE ONLY THING THAT IS KNOWN
IS... HOW CUTE HE IS.

I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, I WANT
TO MAKE LOVE TO HIM

AND THEN EAT HIS HEAD.

I LOVE HIM MORE THAN YOU DO,
HAROLD!

YOU WISH, YOU STUPID BITCH!

- MORTY'S MINE!
- MORTY'S MINE!

MEANT TO BE TOGETHER!

MORTY!

WHERE IS MORTY?

OH, MY GOD, RICK.
THE WHOLE WORLD IS INFECTED!

YEAH, IT'S PRETTY WILD
HOW FAST THAT SPREAD.

I'VE REALLY OUTDONE MYSELF.
- OUTDONE YOURSELF?!

W-W... A-ARE... ARE YOU
KIDDING ME, RICK?

THIS IS NOT OKAY!

NOT ONLY DO THEY ALL WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME,

BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW THEY WANT
TO EAT ME AFTERWARDS!

YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

MANTISES ARE
THE OPPOSITE OF VOLES?

I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, DNA'S MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH,
MORTY?

THIS RIGHT HERE'S GONNA DO
THE TRICK, BABY.

IT'S KOALA MIXED
WITH RATTLESNAKE, CHIMPANZEE,

CACTUS, SHARK,
GOLDEN RETRIEVER,

AND JUST A SMIDGE OF DINOSAUR.

SHOULD ADD UP
TO NORMAL HUMANITY.

I DON'T... THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, RICK.

HOW DOES THAT ADD UP
TO NORMAL HUMANITY?

WHAT, MORTY, YOU WANT ME
TO SHOW YOU MY MATH?

I'M SORRY... A-ARE YOU
THE SCIENTIST

OR ARE YOU THE KID
THAT WANTED TO GET LAID?

WELL, I'M GLAD WE SAVED
ALL THOSE HORSES,

BUT I'M ALMOST SORRY
WE'RE FINISHED.

YES, IT'S SATISFYING
WORK.

UNH-UNH-UNH, IT'S, UH...
IT'S MORE THAN THE WORK.

I LOVE BEING
IN THAT STERILIZED ROOM,

SEALED OFF FROM THE WORLD.

IT'S THE ONLY TIME I CAN
REALLY THINK... AND FEEL.

HMM, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

I'M PLAYING
AFRICAN DREAM POP.

WHAT DO YOU DO
AFTER A LONG NIGHT?

OH, HA, UM, HEY, I B...
I'D BETTER GET GOING.

UM, JERRY'S BEEN TEXTING SOME
PRETTY HIGH-MAINTENANCE STUFF.

- BETH...
- WHAT IS IT, DAVIN?

JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE
TO KNOW...

...W-W-WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO GIVE YOUR SON A BATH.

WHAT?!

WHAT DOES MORTY'S SKIN
SMELL LIKE?

HOW SOFT...

HOW SOFT ARE HIS PRIVATES?

LET GO OF ME, DAVIN!

TAKE ME TO MORTY.

YOU'RE NOT MORTY.

NO, I'M MR. CROWBAR,

AND THIS
IS MY FRIEND,

WHO IS ALSO
A CROWBAR.

THAT'S... STUPID.

YEAH?

WELL, LOOK WHERE BEING
SMART GOT YOU.

JERRY! THANK GOD!

GOD?

GOD'S TURNING PEOPLE
INTO INSECT MONSTERS, BETH.

I'M THE ONE BEATING THEM
TO DEATH.

THANK ME.
- THANK YOU, JERRY.

THANK YOU.

TAKE A GOOD LOOK DOWN THERE,
MORTY, AND SOAK IT IN,

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
ONCE I PULL THIS LEVER,

IT'S ALL BACK TO NORMAL.

JUST DO IT ALREADY.

WELL, TECHNICALLY,
MORTY, THERE'S NO RUSH.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
O-ONCE IT'S FIXED, IT'S DONE.

IT'S FIXED.
YOU KNOW, WE COULD...

WE COULD JUST ENJOY IT
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

I MEAN, I-I-I-LOOK
AT HOW CRAZY IT IS.

I MEAN, MORTY,
W-W-WHEN'S THE NEXT TIME

YOU'RE GONNA SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

I MEAN, SOAK IT IN, YOU KNOW?

IT'S... IT'S PRETTY NEAT.
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING.

THAT'S IT, RICK!
I'M PULLING THE LEVER.

W-WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE,
MORTY?

LOOKS LIKE I WAS RIGHT
AND YOU WERE WRONG, HUH?

I-I-I-I-I BET YOU FEEL PRETTY
STUPID RIGHT ABOUT NOW, HUH?

I-I-I BET YOU FEEL LIKE
THE WORLD'S SMALLEST MAN

THAT YOU WERE DOUBTING ME ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING, MORTY.

OH, RICK, SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT.

YEAH, YOU.

YOU'RE NOT RIGHT... EVER.

NO, NO!
LOOK, YOU IDIOT!

BET YOU'RE LOVING THIS,
MORTY.

THIS MUST BE THE BEST DAY
OF YOUR LIFE.

YOU GET TO BE THE MAYOR
OF I-TOLD-YOU TOWN.

YOU'RE WELCOME.

HOLD ON.

I WISH THAT SHOTGUN
WAS MY PENIS.

IF IT WERE, YOU COULD
CALL ME ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

I DON'T GET IT,
AND I DON'T NEED TO.

MOM! DAD!

SUMMER!

WHERE'S MORTY?

I DON'T KNOW.

DO YOU THINK GRANDPA RICK HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS?

IT'S NOT FAIR TO
ASSUME THAT, SUMMER.

OH, NOT FAIR?
GIVE ME A BREAK.

HE IS A SELFISH,
IRRESPONSIBLE ASS,

AND HE LEFT MY MOTHER.

A REAL MAN STANDS BY
HIS WOMAN.

BOY, I REALLY CRONENBERGED
THE WORLD UP, DIDN'T I?

WE GOT A WHOLE PLANET OF
CRONENBERGS

WALKING AROUND
DOWN THERE, MORTY.

A-AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH YOU ANYMORE, THOUGH.

THAT'S A HUGE STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

OH, MY GOD!
IT'S A LIVING NIGHTMARE!

HOW COULD YOU BE
SO IRRESPONSIBLE, RICK?

ME IRRESPONSIBLE?! YOU...
ALL I WANTED YOU TO DO

WAS HAND ME
A SCREWDRIVER, MORTY!

YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO
BE... WANTED ME TO BUCKLE DOWN

AND MAKE YOU UP A...
ROOFIE-JUICE SERUM

SO YOU COULD ROOFIE THAT
POOR GIRL AT YOUR SCHOOL.

I MEAN, G... W-W-W-W-W... W...
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MORTY?

YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE
THE HIGH ROAD ON THIS ONE?

Y-Y-Y-Y-YOU'RE A LITTLE
CREEP, MORTY.

Y-YOU'RE A... YOU'RE...
YOU'RE...

YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE CREEPY...
CREEP PERSON.

ALL RIGHT, FINE. I SHOULD HAVE
JUST LISTENED TO YOU

WHEN YOU REFUSED TO MAKE
THE SERUM.

I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT MY PART OF
THE BLAME FOR THIS, RICK.

BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING...
YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU GOTTA ACCEPT YOUR PART
OF THE BLAME!

I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO FOULED UP THE SERUM!

I'M NOT THE ONE WHO...
WHO... WHO...

WHO HAPHAZARDLY, YOU KNOW,

MIXED A BUNCH OF NONSENSE
TOGETHER

AND CREATED A BUNCH OF
CRONENBERGS!

YOU GOTTA FIX THIS, RICK!
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, MORTY.

YOU KNOW, W-W-W-WE ARE
IN A PRETTY DEEP HOLE, HERE,

BUT I DO HAVE ONE EMERGENCY
SOLUTION THAT I CAN USE

THAT'LL KIND OF PUT
EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL,

RELATIVELY SPEAKING.

HERE, MORTY, PUT THIS ON
WHILE I DO

A LITTLE BIT
OF SCOUTING.

WOW, RICK, I GOTTA SAY...

YOU REALLY PULLED A RABBIT OUT
OF YOUR HAT THIS TIME.

I MEAN, I-I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT THE WHOLE PLACE

WAS GONNA BE
MESSED UP FOR GOOD,

BUT HERE, YOU DID IT...
Y-Y-YOU... YOU...

YOU FIGURED OUT THAT CRAZY
SOLUTION,

LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

WHOO!
THAT'S SOME GREAT LUCK.

COME ON, MORTY. LUCK HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

I'M GREAT.
THAT'S THE REAL REASON.

NOW, MORTY, WHAT DO YOU
SAY, BUDDY?

WILL YOU HAND ME
A SCREWDRIVER

SO I CAN FINISH MY IONIC
DIS... DEFIBULIZER?

SURE THING, RICK.
HERE'S A SCREWDRIVER.

ALL RIGHT, MORTY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WE GOT ONE SCREW TURN...
AND TWO SCREW TURNS...

AND...

ALL RIGHT, MORTY,
HERE WE ARE.

OH, MY GOD, RICK!
IS THAT US?!

W-W-W-WE'RE DEAD!
WHAT IS GOING ON, RICK?

I'M FREAKING OUT!

CALM DOWN, MORTY!
LOOK AT ME! CALM DOWN, MORTY!

NO, I CAN'T DEAL WITH
THIS!

CALM YOURSELF, MORTY.

I CAN'T DEAL WITH
THIS, RICK!

- CALM DOWN, MORTY.
- THIS CAN'T BE REAL!

- YOU GOTTA CALM DOWN, MORTY.
- W-W-W-W-WE'RE RIPPED APART!

SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME!

IT'S FINE.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

THERE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER
OF REALITIES, MORTY,

AND IN A FEW DOZEN OF THOSE,

I GOT LUCKY AND TURNED
EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL.

I JUST HAD TO FIND ONE
OF THOSE REALITIES

IN WHICH WE ALSO HAPPEN TO BOTH
DIE AROUND THIS TIME.

NOW WE CAN JUST SLIP
INTO THE PLACE

OF OUR DEAD SELVES
IN THIS REALITY

AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

WE'RE NOT SKIPPING A BEAT,
MORTY.

NOW, HELP ME WITH THESE
BODIES.

THIS IS INSANE.

LOOK, MORTY, I'LL GRAB MYSELF,
YOU GRAB YOURSELF, OKAY?

I MEAN, T-T-T-THAT SEEMS
FAIR TO ME...

I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE
A FAIR WAY TO DIVVY IT UP.

RICK, WHAT ABOUT
THE REALITY WE LEFT BEHIND?

WHAT ABOUT THE REALITY WHERE
HITLER CURED CANCER, MORTY?

THE ANSWER IS DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN DO THIS
EVERY WEEK, ANYWAYS.

WE GET THREE OR FOUR MORE
OF THESE, TOPS.

NOW, PICK UP YOUR DEAD SELF
AND COME ON.

HASTE MAKES WASTE.

I-I-I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE
CONSIDERED THIS DETAIL,

BUT OBVIOUSLY, IF I HADN'T
SCREWED UP AS MUCH AS I DID,

WE'D BE THESE GUYS RIGHT NOW,

HE'LL KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

UH, W-W-W-WHERE...
WHERE DO I FIND DR. BLOOM?

IN REUBEN.

REUBEN, MINNE... MINNESOTA?

REUBEN ON THE TABLE, MORTY.

LOOK, I-I-I I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO WRAP YOUR

LITTLE WALNUT
AROUND EVERYTHING.

JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH
UNTIL THE PROCESS IS OVER

OR YOUR LUNGS WILL COLLAPSE.

WHAT PROC...

HEY, DAD, WHERE'S MORTY?

HE'S BUSY.

MORTY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

HEAD NORTH.

RICK, WHERE AM I?

DEPENDING ON MY AIM,

YOU SHOULD BE JUST
SOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE.

ENTRANCE TO WHAT?

WELCOME, MORTY.

WELCOME...

...TO ANATOMY PARK!

IT'S A LITTLE BUSINESS VENTURE
I'VE BEEN COOKING UP ON THE SIDE

WITH DR. BLOOM... AN AMUSEMENT
PARK INSIDE A HUMAN BODY.

SCIENCE ISN'T CH...
CHEAP, MORTY.

THIS SHOULD REALLY HELP
PUT A DENT IN THE OVERHEAD.

OH, MY GOD!

THIS IS INSANE!

SPLEEN MOUNTAIN?

BLADDER FALLS?
PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS?

YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT LAST ONE, MORTY?

HUH? NO, NO.

I'M JUST READING 'EM OUT LOUD IN
THE ORDER THAT I'M SEEING 'EM.

OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

IF I SOUNDED A
LITTLE DEFENSIVE,

IT'S BECAUSE PIRATES OF THE
PANCREAS WAS MY BABY.

YOU KNOW, I GOT...

I GOT A LOT OF PUSHBACK
WHEN I PITCHED IT, MORTY.

I GUESS I'M STILL
A LITTLE DEFENSIVE.

LET'S JUST FIND DR. BLOOM,
ALL RIGHT?

I-I'M PICKING UP A DISTRESS
SIGNAL IN THE LIVER, MORTY.

PROCEED TO THE LIVER.

ARRIVING AT...

...LIVER.

OW!

MIND THE GAP.

IT'S REALLY SCARY
IN HERE, RICK.

THE LIVER'S UNDER MAINTENANCE.

REUBEN'S SEEN SOME
ROUGH YEARS, MORTY.

DON'T JUDGE.

YOU DON'T AGREE TO HAVE A THEME
PARK BUILT INSIDE YOU IF YOUR

LIFE'S GOING GREAT.

RICK! IT'S A MONSTER!

NO, NO, NO. MORTY.

THE ONLY MONSTER HERE IS
ALCO...HOLISM.

THAT IS AN
ANIMATRONIC WEREWOLF.

WHO ARE YOU?!

ANSWER ME!

WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

MY... MY... MY
GRANDPA RICK SENT ME!

PONCHO!

THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

MORTY, THAT'S PONCHO.

THIS IS ROGER AND ANNIE.

AND I AM DR. XENON BLOOM.

HEY, BLOOM, IT'S RICK.

WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THE ENTIRE
SECURITY SYSTEM HAS SHUT DOWN,

AND I'M AFRAID...
THE EXHIBITS ARE UNLOCKED.

EXHIBITS?

ANATOMY PARK'S GREATEST
ATTRACTION, YOUNG MAN,

ISN'T THE MUSIC
OR THE FOOD OR THE...

PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS.

WATCH IT.

IT IS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A
LIVING MUSEUM OF HUMANITY'S MOST

NOBLE AND FEROCIOUS DISEASES.

DISEASES?

HEY, DOC.

I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

YOUR LIVING MUSEUM IS
OFFICIALLY A WILD SAFARI!

HEPATITIS A!
RUN!

OH, THE FOOD GOES
IN YOUR MOUTH, GIRL.

OH, JACOB.

I-I'M SORRY, JACOB.

I-I GUESS I'M STILL CONFUSED
ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE AND

ORIGIN OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY PARENTS.

ARE YOU, LIKE, UH... ARE YOU,
LIKE, THEIR CARETAKER?

IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

WE CAN GO INTO
DETAIL LATER, SON.

NOW, WAIT.
TH-THERE'S NO POINT TO SECRECY.

LET'S ALL LIVE AND DIE HONESTLY.

YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE SHARED
40 YEARS OF EACH OTHER, MIND,

BODY, AND SOUL, AND WHEN
MINDS AND SOULS ARE JOINED

FOR ETERNITY AND WHEN ETERNITY
IS AT THE DOOR,

IT'S AN INVITATION TO LET GO OF
THE BODY AND AN OPPORTUNITY

TO SHARE AND EXPERIMENT.

DAD, PLEASE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
LEONARD, AND WE SUPPORT YOU.

HEY, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
BECAUSE IT

SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SAY JACOB IS YOUR LOVER.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

JACOB IS YOUR MOTHER'S LOVER.

I WATCH THEM...

SOMETIMES FROM A CHAIR AND
SOMETIMES FROM A CLOSET,

ALMOST ALWAYS DRESSED
AS SUPERMAN.

OH.

JERRY, THIS HAM HAS GOT
TO BE ALL YOU, RIGHT?

IT'S INCREDIBLE.

HAPPY HUMAN HOLIDAY, DAD.

AAH!

HEPATITIS WON'T FOLLOW US
INTO THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.

THAT'S STRANGE.

AIRFLOW IS DOWN 20%.

SO, THE BRAIN ISN'T
GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.

THAT'S WHY
SECURITY'S OFFLINE.

WELL, I GUESS WE
BETTER CHECK IT OUT.

HEY! WAIT FOR ME!

PUT THAT BACK ON!

IF WE GOT UP TO THE
BRONCHIAL CATWALK,

WE COULD LOOK
FOR A BLOCKAGE.

I'LL GO.

DON'T BE A HERO, KID.

I'M NOT.

I'M DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S FUN.

WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT
FIRE THAT THING IN HERE.

WE MUST SAVE REUBEN.

THIS IS MY LIFE'S WORK.

IT'S ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR.

NEARLY ALL HUMAN LUNGS CONTAIN A
STRAIN OF THESE BACTERIA,

BUT THE SCAR TISSUE
KEEPS THEM...

DORMANT.

MORTY, GET DOWN!

WHOA-HO-HO!

WHOA!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

OH, WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

TUBERCULOSIS...
COMING IN FAST!

NOT FASTER THAN A BULLET!

AAH!

NO!

DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE?!

WHOA!

GET TO THE DIGESTIVE TRACT!

HE'S COUGHING!

WHOAAAA!

DON'T LET ME DIE!

JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
REUBEN.

YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE!

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

MY NAME IS...

ALEXAND...

RICK... R-R-REUBEN'S GOT
TUBERCULOSIS!

OH, GREAT WORK, MORTY.

OKAY, I'LL JUST
CURE IT AND THEN...

OKAY.

WELL, I CAN'T CURE DEATH.

THIS IS BAD, MORTY.

YOU'RE TRAPPED
IN A DEAD MAN.

LISTEN, IF THE SITUATION
KEEPS DARKENING,

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND POP BY
PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS.

OBVIOUSLY I'M BIASED,
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT, MORTY.

IT'S A BUNCH OF
PIRATES RUNNING AROUND A

PANCREAS.

WE DON'T WHITEWASH IT,
EITHER, MORTY.

I MEAN, THE PIRATES
ARE REALLY RAPEY.

THE TOP PRIORITY IS TO GET,
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS OUT OF THERE,

BUT I'M JUST SAYING, IF THAT
BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE, PLEASE,

YOU GOTTA TREAT YOURSELF.

OH, MAN.

W-W-W-WHAT IS
THAT HORRIBLE SMELL?

YOU MEAN THE PANDA EXPRESS?

KIDDING. I-I'M KIDDING.

THE BODY IS BEGINNING TO
CONSTRICT AND FILL WITH GAS.

WE'RE INSIDE A CORPSE, MY BOY.

ANATOMY PARK IS DOOMED.

FORGET ABOUT THE PARK,
DOCTOR!

HOW DO WE GET OUT?

THE DIGESTIVE TRACT IS THE
EVACUATION ROUTE.

GET IT?

THERE'S AN EMERGENCY STATION IN
THE COLON WITH A RAY THAT CAN

ENLARGE US ALL.

EVERYBODY, HEAD FOR THE COLON!

NOW I'M TAKING ORDERS
FROM A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY?

MORTY, THE SCAR SACS CONTAINING
THE TUBERCULOSIS WERE SABOTAGED.

THIS DISASTER
WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

KEEP YOUR EYE ON ANNIE.

SHE WAS WRITTEN
UP SEVERAL TIMES

BY HER MANAGER
AT THE CHURRO STAND.

INTESTINES ARE AHEAD TO THE
LEFT, THEN TO THE RIGHT,

THEN LEFT, ET CETERA.

HEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I-I-I'M ACTUALLY 14.

SO, YOU KNOW...
WHAT?

NOT 12.

OKAY.

YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
HE JUST SAID I WAS 12.

OH.

GOOD FOR YOU.

OOF. UGH. MORTY.

STRIKE ONE.

♪ A TRAIL OF FOOD ♪

♪ IT'S A PATHWAY TO BREAK
UP THE BAD AND GOOD ♪

♪ IT'S A TUBE THAT DIGESTS
AND THEN SENDS OUT THE REST ♪

IT GOES ON LIKE
THIS FOR MILES.

THEN WE GET TO THE
LARGE INTESTINE!

SHH!
I HEAR SOMETHING.

DON'T MOVE.

GONORRHEA CAN'T SEE
US IF WE DON'T MOVE.

WAIT, I WAS WRONG.

I WAS THINKING OF A T. REX.

MOVE!

WE'RE SITTING DUCKS!

DOC, DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE
BODY WAS FILLING WITH GAS?

YES. WHY?

KID, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

ARE YOU MAD?!

EVERYBODY, IN HERE!

HEY, GONORRHEA!

HOW'S THIS FOR A
BURNING SENSATION?

HUH.

BE CAREFUL WHAT
YOU WISH FOR.

I'M BEING PUNISHED
FOR TAKING YOUR IPAD.

WHAT?

JERRY, LET THAT STUFF GO, OKAY?

I'M SORRY I WAS
A BITCH EARLIER.

LET'S JUST BE HERE.

SUMMER!

ETHAN?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I'VE BEEN TEXTING
YOU FOR HOURS!

WHAT THE HELL?!

I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE!

I'M DOING A HUMAN HOLIDAY!

WELL, DID YOU EVEN CONSIDER
HOW THAT MIGHT MAKE ME FEEL?!

HOW YOU FEEL?!

WHY IS EVERYTHING ALWAYS
HAPPENING TO YOU?!

SUMMER, DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

YEAH, DO YOU, SUMMER?

I DON'T KNOW, ETHAN.

DO I?!

JERRY, NO DISRESPECT,
BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO

CONNECT MORE WITH
YOUR FAMILY, MAN.

I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE
BACKUP GENERATOR TO GET THE

GROWTH RAY ONLINE.

IF IT WORKS, WE'LL BE
REGULAR-SIZED IN A FEW MINUTES.

I JUST HOPE REUBEN'S NOT IN A
ROOM WITH WHITE CARPETS

OR UPHOLSTERY.

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

THE SPHINCTER DAM.

WE BUILT IT WHEN REUBEN BECAME
INCONTINENT,

BUT IT WAS NOT DESIGNED
TO HOLD A CORPSE LOAD.

I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.

EVERYBODY, MOVE
INSIDE THE CIRCLE.

PONCHO?

WHAT IS THIS IN YOUR BACKPACK?

THAT'S BUBONIC PLAGUE!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT, PONCHO?

EVERYBODY, GET BACK!

PONCHO, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

YOU RELEASED THE TUBERCULOSIS
SO YOU COULD STEAL FROM ME?

THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD PAY TOP DOLLAR

TO DECIMATE THE POPULATION.

I'LL TAKE THE HIGHEST BIDDER...

AL-QAEDA, NORTH KOREA,

REPUBLICANS, SHRINERS, BALDING
MEN THAT WORK OUT,

PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE
ONLY TURNED ON BY CARTOONS

OF JAPANESE TEENAGERS...

ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN WORKING
FOR YOU, YOU POMPOUS, NEGLIGENT,

ITUNES-GIFT-CARD-AS-A-HOLIDAY-
BONUS-GIVING MOTHER...

COME ON!

AAH!

GET OFF!

YOU GUYS!

IT'S GONNA BURST! GO!

GO, GO, GO!

MY FOOT IS STUCK.

NO! IT'S OKAY!

IT'S OKAY. JUST GO.
TELL MY FAMILY I LOVE THEM.

THEY MAY BE HARD TO FIND 'CAUSE
MY WIFE KEPT HER LAST NAME AND

SHE MADE THE KIDS TAKE IT, TOO,
SO, I-I DON'T KNOW, YOU CAN...

NO!

LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
ETHAN.

WHERE'S THE ANGER
COMING FROM, MAN?

FROM SUMMER BEING
A TOTAL BITCH!

WHERE'S THE ANGER
COMING FROM?

MY BROTHER...TOOK ME FISHING
ONCE...IN THE BUSHES...

I CAN'T...I CAN'T...

HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE A GIRL!

I... HE MADE ME A GIRL!

HE DIDN'T MAKE
YOU ANYTHING, MAN.

YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.

SHE IS WHO SHE IS.

NOW, YOU GO TO HER...BRAND-NEW.

COME HERE, RIGHT NOW.

OH, MY GOD.

I'M SO SORRY, ETHAN!

I LOVE YOU!

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

UM...

YOU DID IT AGAIN, CUBBIE.

COME HERE.

NO! STOP! I HATE THIS!

WELL, CHRISTMAS DOESN'T REVOLVE
AROUND WHAT YOU HATE, SON.

WELL, THEN I HATE CHRISTMAS!

ENJOY BEING HUMAN!

YOU GUYS ARE GROSS AND LAME.

MY NAME'S REUBEN RIDLEY.

YOU'RE INSIDE ME RIGHT NOW, BUT
BY THE END OF THIS JOURNEY...

WHOOPSIE.

I'LL BE INSIDE ALL OF YOU.

MY STORY BEGINS DURING

THE DOT-COM CRASH
IN THE EARLY '90S.

YOU CAN PUT YOUR FINGERS
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

MORTY, YOU WANT TO PUT IT
ON MUTE OR SOMETHING?

I'M... I'M TRYING TO
CONCENTRATE.

UH...RICK?

NOT NOW, JERRY.

I'VE GOT MUCH,
MUCH SMALLER FISH TO FRY.

I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
I EVER JUDGED YOU.

RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE MY SANEST RELATIVE.

RELATIVE.

R-RELATIVE SIZE!

JERRY, HAND ME A SCALPEL
AND A BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE.

MORTY, CAN YOU GET
TO THE LEFT NIPPLE?

ARE YOU KIDDING?

I'M HOPING I CAN GET
TO BOTH OF 'EM, RICK.

NO, MORTY, I'M TALKING ABOUT
REUBEN'S LEFT NIPPLE.

WE NEED TO GET
TO THE LEFT NIPPLE!

THE BODY IS DECAYING.

THE ARTERIAL TRANSIT
SYSTEM IS USELESS.

WE CAN TRY THE SERVICE SHUTTLE.

IT'S CONNECTED TO
THE SKELETAL SYSTEM.

THAT'S WHY WE CALL
IT THE BONE TRAIN.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO RIDE
THE BONE TRAIN, MISS?

IF IT'LL GET US OUT OF HERE.

HOW ABOUT YOU, MORTY?

WOULD YOU LIKE TO
RIDE THE BONE TRAIN?

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS BIT?

WE'RE GONNA DIE! LET'S GO!

WELL...I CAN SEE YOU'RE BUSY.

MERRY CHRISTMAS, RICK.

THERE'S NO AUTO PILOT.

ONE OF US WILL HAVE TO STAY
HERE AND OPERATE IT MANUALLY.

UH, WELL...
NO, YOU'RE... YOU'RE RIGHT.

I-IT WAS A DICK MOVE FOR ME
TO EVEN PAUSE LIKE THAT.

THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

YOU GO ON.

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

E. COLI OUTBREAK.

HURRY!

WAIT, THERE IS AN AUTOPILOT.

WAIT!

IT'S OKAY! NEVER MIND!

I WANTED TO SACRIFICE
MYSELF ANYWAY!

THEY'RE... THEY'RE CHEWING
THROUGH THE DOORS!

WE'RE IN THE AREOLA, RICK...

ALMOST TO THE NIPPLE, BUT WE'RE
ALSO IN A REALLY BAD SITUATION!

I'M ALMOST THERE, MORTY!

REPORTS FROM ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN COMING IN

ABOUT WHAT A PPEARS
TO BE A GIANT,

NAKED MAN OVER THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.

WE NOW GO TO TOM RANDOLPH
IN NEW YORK. TOM?

WELL, THE EYES AREN'T TWINKLING
AND THE DIMPLES AREN'T MERRY,

BUT I'M STANDING UNDER A
NOSE LIKE A 70-MILE CHERRY.

THANK YOU, TOM.

LET'S GO NOW TO ERIC MCMAHAN
IN LOS ANGELES.

WE'VE GOT FEET HERE ON
THE WEST COAST, BILL...

GIANT FEET,

EVEN RELATIVE TO THE
GIANT MAN'S SIZE,

AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT THAT.

WELL, IF THE OLD
ADAGE IS TRUE,

ONE CAN ONLY WONDER WHAT'S GOING
DOWN IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

WHA?

OH MY GOD, THE TRACK!

IT'S HEPATITIS A!

AAAAH!

THE NIPPLE HOLE.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

OH, NO!

HOLY CRAP!

WHOA! IT'S HEPATITIS C!

UM...WAIT...

DID WE HAVE SOME SORT OF
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM?

I THINK THEY'RE
JUST LIKE THAT?

I THINK THEY'RE
JUST GOOD GUYS.

OH. HUH.

WHERE'S DR. BLOOM?

I'M SORRY, RICK,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

GOD DAMN IT, MORTY.

I ASK YOU TO DO ONE THING!

JERRY DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S MISSING.

HE'LL COME AROUND, BETH.

CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL TIME.

IT HAS FUNNY WAYS OF
BRINGING FAMILIES TOGETHER.

I DON'T KNOW, JACOB.

JERRY GOT AN INVITATION TO BE
ALIVE TODAY, AND HE REJECTED IT.

I DON'T KNOW IF
OUR MARRIAGE WILL...

IT'S RAINING BLOOD!

OH, SHIT. FIND JERRY.

OH, GOD.

JERRY!
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

THE TV SAYS THERE'S
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

THE GIANT, NAKED SKY
SANTA HAS EXPLODED.

BLOOD AND CHUNKS OF VISCERA ARE
RAINING DOWN ON THE COUNTRY.

EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE.

OH, YES.

DAD, CAN I HAVE
MY PHONE BACK?

A SURE, SWEETIE. HERE.

EVERYBODY, TAKE A DEVICE.

IT'LL HELP YOU RELAX.

THIS IS NICE.

YEAH.

LOOK, I GUESS WE REALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING THIS CHRISTMAS, JACOB.

NO, WE DIDN'T, DAD.

NO, WE DIDN'T.

TOO BAD ABOUT DR. BLOOM.

HE WAS A GENIUS...

THE ONLY MAN CAPABLE OF
CREATING A NEW ANATOMY PARK.

ACTUALLY, I STUDIED
DR. BLOOM'S WORK.

I-I-I-I BELIEVE I HAVE THE
KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO CREATE

AN ENTIRELY NEW,
MUCH SAFER PARK.

WHAT ABOUT...

PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS?

I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE
MOST UNDERRATED ATTRACTIONS.

BOO-YAH!
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

HEY, W-W-WHAT THE HELL,
RICK?!

WHAT THE HELL, MAN! I LIKED HER!

I REALLY HAD SOMETHING
GOING THERE, RICK!

YEAH, SO I HEARD.

YOU DODGED A BULLET,
MORTY... TRUST ME.

PUFFY VAGINA.

W-WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A PROBLEM TO ME.

I DON'T KNOW.

COME ON,
LET'S GET SOME STUFFING.

I'M STARVING.

OH, UNBELIEVABLE.

WE GOT... WE GOT A BUNCH OF
ROBOT, COMPUTER PEOPLE,

SITTING AROUND WITH THEIR FACES
STUFFED INTO COMPUTER SCREENS.

DO YOU GUYS REALIZE THAT
CHRIST WAS BORN TODAY?

JESUS CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR,
WAS BORN TODAY.

ARE... ARE... ARE
YOU PEOPLE EVEN HUMAN?

WHAT KIND OF
CHRISTMAS IS THIS?

HEY, RICK? RICK, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

LOUD AND CLEAR, ANNIE.

GREAT.

WE'RE ALSO ON WITH ALEJANDRO,
OUR CHIEF IMAGINARIAN.

HEY, RICK.

NATALIE JACOBS AND CHRIS DESETER
FROM MICROSCOPIC MARKETING,

ZACK FROM ORGAN CONCEPTS,
AND JAMIE FROM NEW MEDIA.

HEY, EVERYBODY.

HI, HOW'S IT GOING? HI, RICK.

SO, PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS.

YEAH. TALK TO ME.

HEY, RICK.
IT'S ALEJANDRO SPEAKING.

UM, SO, WE ASKED OURSELVES,
INTERNALLY...

WE ASKED OURSELVES OVER HERE,

"OKAY, WHAT DOES
A PANCREAS DO?"

AND THE ANSWER WAS,
"DOES IT MAKE PIRATES?"

NO, IT MAKES INSULIN,
YOU KNOW?

SO, WE'RE STARTING
WITH A NEW...

THOSE GUYS ARE
INSIDE ME, HUH?

LIKE, BUILDING A PARK?

THOSE GUYS ARE INSIDE YOU
BUILDING A PIECE OF SHIT, ETHAN!

THEY'RE INSIDE YOU BUILDING
A MONUMENT TO COMPROMISE!

FUCK 'EM.

FUCK THOSE PEOPLE.

FUCK THIS WHOLE THING, ETHAN.

COOL.

AND WHO PAYS ME?

DID YOU GET ANY OF THAT?

IT'S A GOOD-A SHOW!

WHAT'S NEW AT SCHOOL?
-NOTHING.

NOTHING! OH, UH, ONE
OF THE LUNCH LADIES DIED.

THEY FOUND HER IN THE GYM WITH,
LIKE, TWO HOLES IN HER NECK

AND ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED
OUT OF HER.

GOOD LORD! WHO DOES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE.
W-W-WHERE'S THE PEPPER?

WAIT, WHAT?!
VAMPIRES ARE REAL?!

YES, SUMMER, VAMPIRES
ARE REAL. WHO KNEW?

OH, RIGHT, ALL HUMANITY,
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, NOW.

YEAH, SUMMER,
IT'S A BIG UNIVERSE.

GET USED TO IT.
R-RIGHT, RICK?

WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?!

WE'RE GONNA LIVE OUR LIVES
UNTIL WE DIE.

POSSIBLY BY VAMPIRE.
MORE LIKELY AUTO ACCIDENT

OR HEART DISEASE,
BUT POSSIBLY VAMPIRE.

GRANDPA RICK, COULDN'T YOU,
LIKE, USE YOUR SUPERKNOWLEDGE

TO TURN YOURSELF INTO A TEENAGER
AND COME TO OUR SCHOOL

AND HELP US HUNT
THE VAMPIRE DOWN?

UM -- WOW.

YEAH, PRETTY SPECIFIC
PITCH, SUMMER.

I PROBABLY COULD
TURN MYSELF INTO A TEENAGER

AND HANG OUT IN THE
ZIT-COVERED, HORMONE-ADDLED,

LOW-STAKES ASSWORLD
THAT IS HIGH SCHOOL.

BUT HERE'S MY REVERSE-ASK --

WHY IN THE [BLEEP]
WOULD I EVER DO THAT, EVER?

AND HOW DARE YOU
EVEN ASK ME THAT?

AND WHY AREN'T YOU MORE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?

DAD!

BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF,
SWEETIE.

JERRY! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
JUST SAID TO OUR DAUGHTER?

SOR-RY! I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

TO A CONVERSATION
ABOUT VAMPIRES?!

CLEARLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ABOUT VAMPIRES,

BECAUSE I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION,

WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW,
IF YOU EVER

PAID ATTENTION TO ME!

OH, HERE WE GO,
RIGHT TO THE VICTIM ROLE.

AM I A VICTIM, BETH,

OR AM I MARRIED
TO A MEAN, UNFAIR MONSTER

THAT ALWAYS HURTS ME?!

JESUS CHRIST!

WILL YOU FIX YOUR MARRIAGE
OR GET A DIVORCE ALREADY?

WELL, WE TRIED
A COUPLES' THERAPIST.

THAT'S EARTH THERAPY.

YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK A HORSE
TO FIX A MERRY-GO-ROUND.

I MEAN, HE'LL TRY HIS BEST,
BUT MOSTLY,

HE'S JUST GONNA GET HORRIFIED.

I KNOW ABOUT A PLACE OFF-PLANET
WITH A 100% SUCCESS RATE.

WELL, WE WANT TO MAKE IT
WORK, IF WE CAN.

IT'S JUST --
-THEN IT'S SETTLED.

NO NEED TO PACK.
-OH!

LET'S GO, GO, GO, GO!
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

WHO WANTS TO HUNT

RICK?
HOW -- HOW DID YOU --

YEAH, I GOT BORED

THIS MORNING, HOW I BLEW
SUMMER OFF, AND I THOUGHT,

"HEY, WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A GRUMPY DOUCHE, RICK?

GO TO THE GARAGE,
TRANSFER YOUR MIND

O-O-OKAY.

WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND

INTO THIS BODY'S
YOUNG BRAIN,

IT DID WHAT
YOUNG BRAINS DO --

IT SHOVED THE BAD
THOUGHTS INTO THE BACK

AND PUT A WALL
AROUND THEM.

BUT THOSE BAD THOUGHTS
ARE THE REAL RICK.

THE FACT THAT YOU'RE OLD,
THE FACT THAT

WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE,
ONE DAY, THE FACT THAT

THE UNIVERSE IS SO BIG,
NOTHING IN IT MATTERS,

THOSE FACTS
ARE WHO YOU ARE.

SO YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THERE
AND YOU CAN ONLY

COME OUT IN THE FORM OF
TINY RICK'S TEEN ANGST!

WELL, SUMMER, I HEAR

TOBY MATTHEWS ISN'T

I MEAN, DOES YOUR CAR LOOK LIKE
A SMALLER VERSION OF YOUR HOUSE?

NO.

WELL, THAT WOULD BE

DARK MATTER, STAT, OR HE'LL DIE!

INVENTED TO TRAVEL THROUGH

SPACE FASTER THAN

THESE ZIGERIONS ARE ALWAYS
TRYING TO SCAM ME OUT OF MY SECRETS,

BUT THEY MADE A BIG
MISTAKE THIS TIME, MORTY.

THEY DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

NOW THEY'RE GONNA PAY!

WHAT DO YOU...
W-W-WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

WE'LL SCAM THE SCAMMERS,

AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE THEM FOR

NATIONAL APPLE FARMERS OF AMERICA,

WELCOME TO OUR AD AGENCY.

I'M JERRY SMITH.

ALL RIGHT.

I'LL JUST...GET TO THE PITCH.

UM, SIMPLE QUESTION, GENTLEMEN,
WHAT ARE APPLES?

EXCUSE ME.

AHH.

WHAT ARE APPLES?

APPLES ARE FOOD.

AND...WHEN DO WE NEED FOOD?

WHEN WE'RE HUNGRY.

WITH THAT, I GIVE
YOU YOUR NEW SLOGAN!

WELL, SAY SOMETHING!

DO YOU LIKE IT?

YES.

YOU DO?

YES.

SO...I SOLD IT?

I SOLD THE IDEA?

YES.

OH, MY GOD! THANK YOU!

THANK YOU.

YOU'RE WELCOME.

HEY!

I JUST SOLD MY FIRST PITCH!

SLOW DOWN! LOOKIN' GOOD.

MY MAN!

HELLO.

THE APPLES CAMPAIGN.

WHO JUST SOLD

I GUESS IT WASN'T A RIP-OFF

YES.

WELL, ALL IS FORGIVEN,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

I'VE GOT AN ERECTION THE SIZE

AND I SHOULDN'T BE FIRED.

I SHOULD BE PROMOTED!

- YES.
- YEAH!

WAIT. REALLY?

- YES.

WITH A WIFE'S DECISION

TO KEEP HER LOVER INTACT?

WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
FAIR AT ALL, JERRY. AT ALL.

IN FACT, THE WHOLE PARADIGM
HAS SEXIST OVERTONES.

BETH, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS PRIVATELY.

YOU KNOW, I THINK
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, JERRY,

IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR PENIS,
YOU SHOULD SAY, OUT LOUD,

"I PREFER TO KEEP
MY PENIS."

BUT, BETH, WHAT KIND OF MAN
WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT

IF THE UNIVERSE NEEDED
HIS PENIS?!

WELL, JERRY,
WHAT KIND OF WIFE WOULD I BE

IF I DID ANYTHING
TO STAND IN YOUR WAY?

HEY, LISTEN,

IS YOUR MOUTH TINY AND SMALL?

THEN WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO LIL' BITS...
MAN: LIL' BITS!

...WHERE THE FOOD IS TINY.

IT LOOKS LIKE REGULAR FOOD,
BUT REALLY TINY.

YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH
AND EAT IT.

NOTHING GETS STUCK IN YOUR LIPS.

-FITS RIGHT IN.

TODAY ON "HOW THEY DO IT"...

EVERYONE HAS A PLUMBUS
IN THEIR HOME.

FIRST, THEY TAKE THE DINGLEBOP,

AND THEY SMOOTH IT OUT
WITH A BUNCH OF SCHLEEM.

THE SCHLEEM IS THEN REPURPOSED
FOR LATER BATCHES.

THEY TAKE THE DINGLEBOP,

AND THEY PUSH IT
THROUGH THE GRUMBO,

WHERE THE FLEEB
IS RUBBED AGAINST IT.

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE FLEEB
IS RUBBED

BECAUSE THE FLEEB
HAS ALL OF THE FLEEB JUICE.

THEN A SCHLAMI SHOWS UP,

AND HE RUBS IT AND SPITS ON IT.

THEY CUT THE FLEEB.

THERE'S SEVERAL HIZARDS
IN THE WAY.

THE BLAMFS RUB
AGAINST THE CHUMBLES.

AND THE PLOOBIS AND GRUMBO
ARE SHAVED AWAY.

YOU'LL BE TAKING
MOST OF THEIR ENERGY.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I GET IT.

[ BURPS ]
IT'S SHOW[BURPS]TIME.

YOU DO REALIZE THIS WILL MAKE
THE FLOOBLE CRANK OBSOLETE?

THIS IS WRONG, KYLE.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG.

YOU'RE BASICALLY --
[SCOFFS] THIS IS SLAVERY.

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING
A PLANET OF SLAVES.

[ BURPS ]
TOLD YOU, ZEEP.

OH, THEY WON'T BE SLAVES.

THEY'LL WORK FOR EACH OTHER
AND PAY EACH OTHER MONEY.

THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SLAVERY
WITH EX...TRA...STEPS.

WHAT?
WAIT A MINUTE.

DID YOU CREATE MY UNIVERSE?
IS MY UNIVERSE A MINIVERSE?

MICROVERSE!

UH, TEENYVERSE.

UGH!
YOU BASTARD!

MUCH OBLIGED.

WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?
THIS IS HEALTHY.
TRUST ME.

YOU'RE MY BATTERY,
MOTHER[BLEEP]

[ GROANS ]
THAT'S ALL YOU ARE.

I MADE YOU.
YOUR MICROVERSE SUCKS!

AND YOUR MINIVERSE IS THE SIZE
OF A [BLEEP] LOBSTER TANK!

IT'S WHACK!

ARE THEY
NOT REALLY ALIENS?

NAH, THEY'RE JUST
A COUPLE OF CRAZY,

WACKY SCIENTISTS,
YOU KNOW?

SO HE MADE
A UNIVERSE,

AND THAT GUY IS
FROM THAT UNIVERSE.

YOU'RE MY BATTERY!
AND THAT GUY MADE
A UNIVERSE.

AND THAT'S THE UNIVERSE
WHERE I WAS BORN.

WHERE MY FATHER DIED.

WHERE I COULDN'T MAKE TIME
FOR HIS FUNERAL

BECAUSE I WAS WORKING
ON MY UNIVERSE.

I MADE YOU!
[ LAUGHS ] YEAH.

SCIENCE, HUH?
AIN'T IT A THING.

YOU KNOW, ONE TIME,
RICK SH-- ACCIDENTALLY SHOT

HIS LASER PISTOL
RIGHT THROUGH MY HAND.

YOU KNOW, I MEAN, LIKE,
OLD-LADY SCIENCE, YOU KNOW?

SHE'S A REAL --

YOU GOT TO HANG ON TIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

BECAUSE SHE -- SHE'LL --
SHE BUCKS PRETTY HARD.

OOH, BOY, WHAT --
OH, MY GOD, NO!

TEENYVERSE.
TEENYVERSE.

COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

PTERODACTYL!

[ LAUGHS ]
ASSHOLE!

WHEN I GET
OUT OF THIS TEENYVERSE,

I'M GONNA SMASH IT TO PIECES
WITH YOU IN IT.

YEAH, WELL, WHEN I GET
OUT OF THIS TEENYVERSE,

I'M GONNA GET OUT OF
THE SURROUNDING MINIVERSE

AND THEN THE MICROVERSE
AROUND THAT, AND GUESS WHAT?

DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE,
RICK!

UH, HE'S NOT GONNA DESTROY
YOUR UNIVERSE.

YOU KNOW, WE -- WE NEED IT
TO START OUR CAR.

THAT'S WHAT YOU USED
MY UNIVERSE FOR?

TO RUN YOUR CAR?

YEAH, BUT DON'T
FLATTER YOURSELF.

THERE'S ALWAYS AAA,
YOU [BLEEP] [BLEEP]SUCKER!

WHAT'S HE DOING?
WHAT'S HE CRAFTING?

I CAN CRAFT STUFF,
TOO, PAL!

JUST LIKE I CRAFTED
YOUR REALITY!

YOU CRAFTY SON OF A --

OW!

I CRAFTED THE GUY

THAT CREATED THE PLANET
YOU'RE STANDING ON!

YEAH, AND I MADE THE STARS
THAT BECAME THE CARBON
IN YOUR MOTHER'S OVARIES!

I DIDN'T ASK TO BE BORN!

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!
I'M OUT.

I-I'M GONNA GO
INTO THE WILDERNESS,

AND I'M GONNA MAKE
A NEW LIFE FOR MYSELF
AMONG THE TREE PEOPLE.

I-IT CAN'T BE WORSE
THAN THIS.
RICK: SURE. OKAY, MORTY.

JUST BE BACK BEFORE SUNDOWN
OR THE TREE PEOPLE WILL EAT YOU.

THAT'S A MYTH!

W-W-WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO START A MYTH?

IT'S A PREHISTORIC PLANET,
MORTY.

SOMEONE HAS TO BRING
A LITTLE CULTURE.

AND I-I-IT CERTAINLY
CAN'T BE SOMEONE

WHOSE ENTIRE CULTURE POWERS
MY BRAKE LIGHTS!

[ SIRENS WAILING ]

GO, GO, GO!

OH, MY GOD.
OH, GOD.

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

FEMALE VOICE: I AM UNABLE
TO DESTROY THIS ARMY.

TO CLARIFY, I AM QUITE ABLE
TO DESTROY THIS ARMY,

BUT YOU WILL NOT PERMIT IT.
CORRECT.

YOU ALSO REFUSE TO AUTHORIZE
EMOTIONAL COUNTERMEASURES.

IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE MELTING GHOST BABIES,

YES, PLEASE,
NO MORE OF THAT.

[ WARBLE ]
CONFIRMED.

[ SIGHS ]
I AM CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING
A SECURITY MEASURE

IN COMPLIANCE
WITH YOUR PARAMETERS.

BUT I DO WANT TO SAY
YOU ARE NOT MAKING THIS EASY.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE
KIND OF A DICK, RIGHT?

MY FUNCTION IS
TO KEEP SUMMER SAFE,

NOT KEEP SUMMER BEING,
LIKE, TOTALLY STOKED

ABOUT, LIKE,
THE GENERAL VIBE AND STUFF.

THAT'S YOU.
THAT'S HOW YOU TALK.

HEY, THAT'S MY DEER!

AAAAAAAH!

RAAH!

I HOPE YOUR GOD IS
AS BIG A DICK AS YOU.

MY GOD'S THE BIGGEST DICK
THAT'S NEVER EXISTED.

WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M EVEN HERE?

[ SNAKE HISSES ]

[ EAGLE SCREECHES ]
YOU'RE HERE

BECAUSE YOU CREATED
SOMEONE SMARTER THAN YOU.

OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE BOTH
HERE BECAUSE I CREATED
A UNIVERSE OF IDIOTS.

KALO KADA SHA LA.

HOLY SHIT.
MORTY?

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN MONTHS.

YOU'RE LEADING
THE TREE PEOPLE?

HUH.
THAT'S A STEP UP.

WE HAVE NO LEADERS.

WE FOLLOW
ONLY THE WILL OF THE FOREST.

OOH. WOW.

GAAAAAY.

THAT IS PRETTY GAY.

YOU TWO CALL YOURSELVES
GENIUSES,

BUT YOU HAVE SPENT
THIS TIME LEARNING NOTHING.

COME WITH ME
INTO THE FOREST.

THERE IS SOMETHING
I WISH TO TEACH YOU.

THIS IS KU'ALA,
THE SPIRIT TREE.

FOR GENERATIONS,
IT HAS GUIDED THE --

YOU HAVE TO GET US
THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.

THESE PEOPLE ARE
BACKWARDS SAVAGES.

THEY EAT
EVERY THIRD BABY

BECAUSE THEY THINK
IT MAKES FRUIT GROW BIGGER.

EVERYONE'S GROSS, AND THEY ALL
SMELL LIKE PISS ALL THE TIME.

I M-- I M--
I MISS MY FAMILY.
I MISS MY LAPTOP.

I MASTURBATED TO AN
EXTRA-CURVY PIECE OF
DRIFTWOOD THE OTHER DAY!

LOOK, I-I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT TAKES.

YOU TWO ARE PUTTING ASIDE
YOUR BULL[BLEEP],

AND YOU'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO GET US BACK HOME.

NO CAN DO, MORTY.
I JUST CAN'T.

I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN --

RO RO DAH NO GAH!

YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

[ GUNS COCKING ]
YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS

TO GET OUT OF THE SHIP!

10, 9...

ALL RIGHT, NOT BAD.

I GUESS YOU'RE
AN OKAY PROTO RECOMBINATOR.

I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN
WORSE IONIC CELL DIOXINATION.

IF THIS WORKS,
DRINKS ARE ON ME.

IF DRINKS ARE ON YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

A SECOND MORTGAGE
ON THAT TOWER.

I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

OPIUM ADDICT.

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY, WRAP IT UP.

YOU GUYS ARE
THE [BLEEP] WORST!
YOUR GODS ARE A LIE!

[BLEEP] YOU, [BLEEP] NATURE,
AND [BLEEP] TREES!

YES! YOU DID IT!
YES!

HEY, UH,
HOW ABOUT THAT DRINK?

SURE, I JUST NEED TO GO GRAB
MY WALLET FROM INSIDE MY SHIP.

OH, IS YOUR WALLET
IN YOUR SHIP?

THAT'S WHERE
THE TRANSPORTER IS, TOO,

SO WHY DON'T WE
COME WITH?

IT'S COOL.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

YOU KNOW HOW LONG A SECOND CAN
TAKE IN A MICROVERSE?

RUN, MORTY!

THAT ASSHOLE'S WILLING TO
RISK EVERYTHING HE CARES
ABOUT JUST TO DEFEAT ME!

HE'S PSYCHOTIC!

[ BOTH PANT ]

MORTY,
HOP ON MY BACK.
WHY?

GO, GO [BURPS]
SANCHEZ SKI SHOES.

AAAAAAH!
...EIGHT...

[ PANTING ]

AAAAH!
OOF!

[ ALL GRUNTING ]

[ GRUNTS ]

OH, HEY, GUYS. I JUST
FINISHED COOKING US A FEAST.

AAAAH!
HOLY --

YOU MONSTER!
WHOA. BAD TOUR.

...SEVEN...

[ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ]
HEY, YOU GOT
TO SIGN OUT.

NOTHING YOU DO MATTERS!
YOUR EXISTENCE IS A LIE!

IF THAT WERE
REALLY TRUE, THEN...

I'M HERE
TO SEE RON MENDLESON.
THIRD FLOOR.

WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO DINNER WITH --

UH, NO.

[ BOTH PANTING ]

YOU MAY HAVE CREATED
THIS UNIVERSE, RICK,
BUT I LIVE IN IT.

[BLEEP]

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, RICK?
WE'RE SO SCREWED.

HE'S GONNA GET TO THE SHIP
AND SMASH THE MICROVERSE,
AND THEN HE'S GONNA KILL US!

QUICK, MORTY, YOU'VE GOT
TO TURN INTO A CAR.
WHAT?!

A LONG TIME AGO, I IMPLANTED YOU
WITH A SUBDERMAL CHIP

THAT COULD CALL UPON
DORMANT NANOBOTS IN
YOUR BLOODSTREAM

TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR ANATOMY
AND TURN YOU INTO A CAR.

OH, MY GOD!
CONCENTRATE, MORTY.

CONCENTRATE AND TURN
INTO A CAR, MORTY.

[ GRUNTS ]

NEVER MIND. HERE'S A TAXI.
GET IN. IT'S FINE.

...SIX...

HEY, ZEEP.
HUH?

HAPPY RICKSGIVING,
BIIIIIITCH.

AAAH!

WE DID IT, MORTY.

NOW LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
AND DESTROY THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE.

EXCUSE ME?

...FIVE --

SIR?

[ SPIDERS HISS ]

HOLY HELL.
SIR!

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

HOLD YOU FIRE!

[ SPIDER SNARLS ]

WHAT'S GOING ON?

FEMALE VOICE: I HAVE BROKERED
A PEACE AGREEMENT

BETWEEN THE GIANT SPIDERS
AND THE GOVERNMENT.

THANKS TO THE SKILLED DIPLOMACY
OF THIS MYSTERIOUS SPACE CAR,

FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,
HUMAN- AND SPIDERKIND WILL LIVE

SIDE BY SIDE IN PEACE.

WE WILL STOP BOMBING THEM,
AND THEY WILL NO LONGER USE

THEIR TELEPATHIC ABILITIES
TO MAKE US WANDER INTO WEBS

FOR LATER CONSUMPTION.

INSTEAD, WE WILL WORK TOGETHER
TO MAKE THIS WORLD

A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL,
NO MATTER HOW MANY LEGS.

WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE SPACE CAR?

LEAVE IT ALONE.

I MEAN, WHAT DID IT
REALLY DO, ANYWAYS?

KILL A GUY
AND PARALYZE HIS BUDDY?

[CHUCKLES] NOT A BAD TRADE
FOR SPIDER PEACE.

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
MOVE OUT!

[ LAUGHS ]
I LOVE THIS SPIDER!

FEMALE VOICE:
SUMMER IS SAFE.

ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

RICK!

[ THUNDER CRASHES ]

DON'T DO IT.

YOU QUIT SCHOOL, BUT YOU
STILL GOT SOME LEARNING TO DO.

[ BOTH GROAN ]

AAH!

UNH!

[ SNORTS, SPITS ]

CLASS DISMISSED.

GEEZ.

[ BOTTLES CLATTER ]

YOU ALL RIGHT?
UH-HUH!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
RICK?

I'M PRETTY SURE
THE BATTERY'S DEAD.

OH, YOU THINK SO,
HUH, MORTY?

WELL, LET'S SEE.
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

HEY, WAIT -- HUH?
I DON'T GET IT.

OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
BUT ZEEP DID.

HE KNEW THAT ONCE I GOT
BACK TO MY CAR,

ONE OF TWO THINGS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN --

I WAS GONNA HAVE TO TOSS
A BROKEN BATTERY,

OR THE BATTERY WOULDN'T
BE BROKEN.

PEACE AMONG WORLDS, RICK.

JESUS.

YEAH.
LISTEN TO THAT BABY PURR.

YOU WERE RIGHT, MORTY --
WE REALLY JUST NEEDED TO
BE HONEST WITH THOSE GUYS.

ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

THANK Y-O-O-OU.

SEE, MORTY?
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

THIS IS WHY WE DO
WHAT WE DO.

UH-HUH.
EW! WHAT THE HELL?

JESUS!
THERE'S FLIES IN MY ICE CREAM.

PRESIDENTIAL DECREE --

ALL ICE CREAM IS NOW
FOR ALL BEINGS,

NO MATTER HOW MANY LEGS.

WHAT THE [BLEEP]
DID YOU DO, SUMMER?!
IT WAS YOUR SHIP!

YOUR STUPID SHIP DID IT!
DON'T BLAME MY SHIP!

IT MELTED A CHILD!
MY SHIP DOESN'T DO ANYTHING...

IT KILLED IT ITSELF!
...UNLESS IT'S TOLD
TO DO SOMETHING!

WE ALMOST DIED!
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, SUMMER!

[ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ]
YOUR BOOBS ARE
ALL HANGING ABOUT,

AND YOU RUINED ICE CREAM
WITH YOUR BOOBS OUT.

AND DON'T EVEN TRY
TO DENY IT, EITHER.

MORTY: YEAH, YOU KNOW?

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE AIR

RICK: UH, SURE, BUDDY. YEAH.

MORTY: OH. RESPONSIVE, TOO.

IN REAL TIME. I LOVE IT.

MORTY: UHH...OKAY.

I AM GOING TO WORK. GOODBYE.

MORTY: WHAT'S WITH MOM?

RICK: OH, WHAT'S WITH MOM?

SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT SHE'S

MORTY: ALL RIGHT, WELL...

I'LL SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

OOH, OOH!

HOW DO YOU MAKE CONCENTRATED

OH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

MORTY: CONCENTRATED HUH?

CONCENTRATED DARK MATTER

NOW, DO YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT?

MORTY: UMM...

ISN'T YOUR GRANDPA, LIKE, A

SCIENTIST?

MORTY: OH, YEAH, BUT, YOU

KNOW, HE TOLD ME THAT I

SHOULDN'T GO AROUND SPOUTING OFF

I BET YOU'VE SEEN HIM MAKE

[ BLAM! ]

RICK: MORTY, U-UH, COME ON.

THERE'S A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

STOP RIGHT THERE!

IF HE LEAVES, I'M GIVING HIM AN

MORTY: UGH!

I'M GONNA GET AN "F" IN CLASS,

RICK.

RICK: MORTY, THAT'S NOT

T-T-T-THAT WASN'T YOUR TEACHER.

THIS ISN'T YOUR SCHOOL.

THIS ENTIRE WORLD IS NOT THE

WE'RE INSIDE A HUGE SIMULATION

CHAMBER ON AN ALIEN SPACESHIP.

MORTY: WAIT A MINUTE.

W-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

RICK: IT'S ALL FAKE [BURPS]

MORTY ALL OF IT.

NANOBOTIC RENDERINGS, A BUNCH OF

CRAZY FAKE NONSENSE, MORTY.

I COULDN'T SAY SO UNTIL WE GOT

THEY WON'T MONITOR US IN HERE.

MORTY: MONITOR US?! W-WHO?!

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!

WHERE'S THE ABDUCTIONS

HEY, MAN, ABDUCTIONS JUST

FOLLOWS THE ACQUISITION ORDER.

DON'T PUT THIS ON

IT WAS NO ONE'S FAULT.

OH, OKAY. [ CHUCKLES ]

I'M SORRY.

WELL, THEN, PROBLEM SOLVED.

DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS [BURPS]

WORLD IS REAL?

YOU'D HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT NOT TO

NOTICE ALL THE SLOPPY DETAILS.

LOOK THAT GUY'S PUTTING A BUN

BETWEEN TWO HOT DOGS.

MORTY: I DON'T KNOW, RICK.

I MEAN, I'VE SEEN PEOPLE DO THAT

BEFORE.

RICK: WELL, LOOK AT THAT OLD

SHE'S SHE'S WALKING A CAT ON

A LEASH.

MORTY: UH, MRS. SPENCER DOES

SHE'S AN IDIOT!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, THERE.

W-WHAT ABOUT THAT, MORTY?

MORTY: OKAY, OKAY, YOU GOT ME

ON THAT ONE.

RICK: OH, REALLY,MORTY?

ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

THAT SOMEWHERE IN REAL LIFE

BEFORE?

MORTY: NO, NO.

I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.

I MEAN, WHY WOULD A POP TART

WANT TO LIVE INSIDE A TOASTER,

RICK?

I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE, LIKE, THE

SCARIEST PLACE FOR THEM TO LIVE.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

RICK: YOU'RE MISSING THE

POINT, MORTY.

WHY WOULD HE DRIVE A SMALLER

TOASTER WITH WHEELS?

I MEAN, DOES YOUR CAR LOOK LIKE

A SMALLER VERSION OF YOUR HOUSE?

NO.

MORTY: SO, WHY ARE THEY DOING

THIS?

W-WHAT DO THEY WANT?

RICK: WELL, THAT WOULD BE

OBVIOUS TO YOU, MORTY, IF YOU'D

BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

WH-WHAT DO YOU THINK, ICE?
PROBABLY A LITTLE OVERDEVELOPED.

SHIT, OVERDEVELOPED,
UNDERDEVELOPED --

A BAD SONG'S A BAD SONG.

WELL, DO YOU THINK,
MAYBE --

COULD YOU GIVE ME
SOME HELP WITH IT, OR...?

AW, HELL NO, MAN.

YOU DO YOUR THING,
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO

GET MY PRIDE WRAPPED UP
IN YOUR SHAME.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

ICE, I DON'T WANT TO BE
A NEGATIVE NELLY OR ANYTHING,

BUT [BURPS] IF MORTY DOESN'T
COME BACK WITH MY PORTAL GUN

AND I EAT IT OUT THERE,

IT'S, UH, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF YOUR PROBLEM, TOO.

PFFT! I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT
NO EARTH BLOWING UP, MAN.

WHAT? WHY NOT?

YO, THIS IS WHY.

WHAT THE [BLEEP]
YOU CAN TURN INTO ICE?

MY STORY BEGINS
AT THE DAWN OF TIME

IN THE FARAWAY REALM
OF ALPHABETRIUM.

THERE, EVERY BEING
IS A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET.

BUT I WAS FROZEN AND EXILED
TO THE COSMOS BY MY ELDERS

AS PUNISHMENT FOR NOT
CARING ENOUGH ABOUT ANYTHING.

EARTH IS JUST
ONE OF MY MANY STOPS

ON A LIFELONG JOURNEY
WITH NO DESTINATION.

SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE
I DON'T CARE IF IT BLOWS UP,

BECAUSE I'LL JUST BE
ICE FLOATING THROUGH SPACE,

LIKE A COMET.

TAKE IT FROM ME, ICE,
[BURPS] YOU CAN'T JUST [BURPS]

FLOAT AROUND SPACE
NOT CARING ABOUT STUFF FOREVER.

PFFT.
MAN, WATCH ME.

GOOD LUCK, RICK.

OKAY, THINGS ARE GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

I BETTER MAKE SURE
RICK HAS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS

TO GET SCHWIFTY.

OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING,
NATHAN?!

I'M THE GODDAMN PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED [BLEEP] STATES!

I'M SETTING THE NUCLEAR OPTION

AND YOU,
MR. PRESIDENT...

I HOPE YOU LIKE BEING
HIT IN THE FACE WITH A GUN.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHY -- WHY --

I BELIEVE I CAN ACCESS
THE HISTORY OF RICK'S GUN

AND HELP YOU
GET BACK TO HIM.

BUT CAN YOU HELP ME
GET TO MY FAMILY?

YOU KNOW,
AT -- AT MY HOUSE?

IS YOUR INTENTION
TO ABANDON RICK

USING HIS OWN PORTAL GUN?

IN BIRD CULTURE,
THIS IS CONSIDERED A DICK MOVE.

ALL OF RICK'S MOVES
ARE DICK MOVES!

WHAT --
WHAT AM I EATING?

WH-WHAT IS THIS,

IT IS RANDOM DEBRIS.
I FOUND IT IN MY CARPET.

WHAT HUMANS EAT.

BIRDPERSON,
YOU ALWAYS STICK UP FOR RICK,

BUT HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE BUT HIMSELF.

HE DOESN'T THINK ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCES

OF ANYTHING HE DOES.

AND AS A RESULT,
HE HAS THE POWER

TO SAVE OR DESTROY
ENTIRE WORLDS.

AND HE IS THE REASON
YOU AND I KNOW EACH OTHER...

AND THE REASON
I'M ALIVE AT ALL.

ABANDON RICK.

I'M SORRY?

WE'VE BEEN WAITING
16 YEARS

FOR OUR DAUGHTER
TO RESPECT US,

BUT THE KEY IS,
IT HAS TO BE OUR DAUGHTER,
